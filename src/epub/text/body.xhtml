<h2>Chapter I. <br/> The Episode in the Plymouth Hotel</h2>

<p>When the White Rabbit in <i>Alice</i> asked where he should
begin to read the verses at the Knave’s trial the King
replied: “Begin at the beginning; go on till you come to
the end; then stop.”</p>

<p>This would seem to be the last word on the subject of
narration in general. For the novelist no dictum more
entirely complete and satisfactory can be imagined—in
theory. But in practice it is hard to live up to.</p>

<p>Where is the beginning of a story? Where is the
beginning of anything? No one knows.</p>

<p>When I set myself to consider the actual beginning of
Maxwell Cheyne’s adventure, I saw at once I should have
to go back to Noah. Indeed I was not at all sure whether
the thing could be adequately explained unless I carried
back the narrative to Adam, or even further. For Cheyne’s
adventure hinged not only on his own character and
environment, brought about by goodness knows how many
thousands of generations of ancestors, but also upon the
contemporaneous history of the world, crystallized in the
happening of the Great War and all that appertained
thereto.</p>

<p>So then, in default of the true beginning, let us
commence with the character and environment of Maxwell
Cheyne, following on with the strange episode which took
place in the Edgecombe Hotel in Plymouth, and from which
started that extraordinary series of events which I have
called The Cheyne Mystery.</p>

<p>Maxwell Cheyne was born in 1891, so that when his
adventure began in the month of March, 1920, he was just
twenty-nine. His father was a navy man, commander of
one of His Majesty’s smaller cruisers, and from him the
boy presumably inherited his intense love of the sea and
of adventure. Captain Cheyne had Irish blood in his veins
and exhibited some of the characteristics of that irritating
though lovable race. He was a man of brilliant attainments,
resourceful, dashing, spirited and, moreover, a fine
seaman, but a certain impetuosity, amounting at times to
recklessness, just prevented his attaining the highest rank
in his profession. In character he was as straight as a die,
and kindly, generous, and openhanded to a fault, but he
was improvident and inclined to live too much in the
present. And these characteristics were destined to affect
his son’s life, not only directly through heredity, but
indirectly through environment also.</p>

<p>When Maxwell was nine his father died suddenly, and
then it was found that the commander had been living up
to his income and had made but scant provision for his
widow and son and daughter. Dreams of Harrow and
Cambridge had to be abandoned and, instead, the boy was
educated at the local grammar school, and then entered
the office of a Fenchurch Street shipping firm as junior
clerk.</p>

<p>In his twentieth year the family fortunes were again
reversed. His mother came in for a legacy from an uncle,
a sheep farmer in Australia. It was not a fortune, but it
meant a fairly substantial competence. Mrs. Cheyne bought
back Warren Lodge, their old home, a small Georgian
house standing in pleasant grounds on the estuary of the
Dart. Maxwell thereupon threw up his job at the shipping
office, followed his mother to Devonshire, and settled down
to the leisurely life of a country gentleman. Among other
hobbies he dabbled spasmodically in literature, producing
a couple of novels, one of which was published and sold
with fair success.</p>

<p>But the sea was in his blood. He bought a yacht, and
with the help of the gardener’s son, Dan, sailed her in
fair weather and foul, thereby gaining skill and judgment
in things nautical, as well as a first-hand knowledge of the
shores and tides and currents of the western portion of the
English Channel.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that when, three years after the
return to Devon, the war broke out, he volunteered for the
navy and was at once accepted. There he served with
enthusiasm if not with distinction, gaining very much the
reputation which his father had held before him. During
the intensive submarine campaign he was wounded in an
action with a U-boat, which resulted in his being invalided
out of the service. On demobilization he returned home and
took up his former pursuits of yachting, literature, and
generally having as slack and easy a time as his energetic
nature would allow. Some eighteen months passed, and
then occurred the incident which might be said definitely
to begin his Adventure.</p>

<p>One damp and bleak March day Cheyne set out for
Plymouth from Warren Lodge, his home on the estuary of
the Dart. He wished to make a number of small purchases,
and his mother and sister had entrusted him with
commissions. Also he desired to consult his banker as to some
question of investments. With a full program before him
he pulled on his oilskins, and having assured his mother
he would be back in time for dinner, he mounted his
motor bicycle and rode off.</p>

<p>In due course he reached Plymouth, left his machine at
a garage, and set about his business. About one o’clock he
gravitated towards the Edgecombe Hotel, where after a
cocktail he sat down in the lounge to rest for a few
minutes before lunch.</p>

<p>He was looking idly over <i>The Times</i> when the voice of
a page broke in on his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Gentleman to see you, sir.”</p>

<p>The card which the boy held out bore in fine script the
legend: “Mr. Hubert Parkes, Oakleigh, Cleeve Hill,
Cheltenham.” Cheyne pondered, but he could not recall anyone
of the name, and it passed through his mind that the page
had probably made a mistake.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Here sir,” the boy answered, and a short, stoutly built
man of middle age with fair hair and a toothbrush
mustache stepped forward. A glance assured Cheyne that
he was a stranger.</p>

<p>“Mr. Maxwell Cheyne?” the newcomer inquired
politely.</p>

<p>“My name, sir. Won’t you sit down?” Cheyne pulled an
easy chair over towards his own.</p>

<p>“I’ve not had the pleasure of meeting you before, Mr.
Cheyne,” the other went on as he seated himself, “though
I knew your father fairly intimately. I lived for many years
at Valetta, running the Maltese end of a produce company
with which I was then connected, and I met him when
his ship was stationed there. A great favorite, Captain
Cheyne was! The dull old club used to brighten up when
he came in, and it seemed a national loss when his ship
was withdrawn to another station.”</p>

<p>“I remember his being in Malta,” Cheyne returned,
“though I was quite a small boy at the time. My mother
has a photograph of Valetta, showing his ship lying in the
Grand Harbor.”</p>

<p>They chatted about Malta and produce company work
therein for some minutes, and then Mr. Parkes said:</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Cheyne, though it is a pleasure to make the
acquaintance of the son of my old friend, it was not merely
with that object that I introduced myself. I have, as a
matter of fact, a definite piece of business which I should
like to discuss with you. It takes the form of a certain
proposition of which I would invite your acceptance, I
hope, to our mutual advantage.”</p>

<p>Cheyne, somewhat surprised, murmured polite expressions
of anxiety to hear details and the other went on:</p>

<p>“I think before I explain the thing fully another small
matter wants to be attended to. What about a little lunch?
I’m just going to have mine and I shall take it as a favor
if you will join me. After that we could talk business.”</p>

<p>Cheyne readily agreed and the other called over a waiter
and gave him an order. “Let us have a cocktail,” he went
on, “and by that time lunch will be ready.”</p>

<p>They strolled to the bar and there partook of a wonderful
American concoction recommended by the young lady
in charge. Presently the waiter reappeared and led the way,
somewhat to Cheyne’s surprise, to a private room. There
an excellent repast was served, to which both men did full
justice. Parkes proved an agreeable and well informed
companion and Cheyne enjoyed his conversation. The
newcomer had, it appeared, seen a good deal of war service,
having held the rank of major in the department of supply,
serving first at Gallipoli and then at Salonica. Cheyne
knew the latter port, his ship having called there on three
or four occasions, and the two men found they had various
experiences in common. Time passed pleasantly until at
last Parkes drew a couple of arm chairs up to the fire,
ordered coffee, and held out his cigar case.</p>

<p>“With your permission I’ll put my little proposition now.
It is in connection with your literary work and I’m afraid
it’s bound to sound a trifle impertinent. But I can assure
you it’s not meant to be so.”</p>

<p>Cheyne smiled.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid of hurting my feelings,” he
declared. “I have a notion of the real value of my work.
Get along anyway and let’s hear.”</p>

<p>Parkes resumed with some hesitation.</p>

<p>“I have to say first that I have read everything that you
have published and I am immensely impressed by your
style. I think you do your descriptions extraordinarily well.
Your scenes are vivid and one feels that one is living
through them. There’s money in that, Mr. Cheyne, in that
gift of vivid and interest-compelling presentation. You
should make a good thing out of short stories. I’ve worked
at them for years and I know.”</p>

<p>“Huh. I haven’t found much money in it.”</p>

<p>Parkes nodded.</p>

<p>“I know you haven’t, or rather I guessed so. And if you
don’t mind, I’ll tell you why.” He sat up and a keener
interest crept into his manner. “There’s a fault in those
stories of yours, a bad fault, and it’s in the construction.
But let’s leave that for the moment and you’ll see where
all this is leading.”</p>

<p>He broke off as a waiter arrived with the coffee,
resuming:</p>

<p>“Now I have a strong dramatic sense and a good working
knowledge of literary construction. As I said I’ve also tried
short stories, and though they’ve not been an absolute
failure, I couldn’t say they’ve been really successful. On the
whole, I should think, yours have done better. And I know
why. It’s my style. I try to produce a tale, say, of a
shipwreck. It is intended to be full of human feeling, to grip
the reader’s emotion. But it doesn’t. It reads like a Board
of Trade report. Dry, you understand; not interesting. Now,
Mr. Cheyne,” he sat up in his chair once more, this time
almost in excitement, “you see what I’m coming to. Why
should we not collaborate? Let me do the plots and you
clothe them. Between us we have all the essentials for
success.”</p>

<p>He sat back and then saw the coffee.</p>

<p>“I say,” he exclaimed, “I’m sorry, but I didn’t notice this
had come. I hope it’s not cold.” He felt the coffee pot.
“What about a liquor? I’ll ring for one. Or rather,” he
paused suddenly. “I think I’ve got something perhaps even
better here.” He put his hand in his pocket and drew out
a small flask. “Old Cognac,” he said. “You’ll try a little?”</p>

<p>He poured some of the golden brown liquid into
Cheyne’s cup and was about to do the same into his own
when he was seized with a sudden fit of choking coughing.
He had to put down the flask while he quivered and shook
with the paroxysm. Presently he recovered, breathless.</p>

<p>“Since I was wounded,” he gasped apologetically, “I’ve
been taken like that. The doctors say it’s purely nervous—that
my throat and lungs and so on are perfectly sound.
Strange the different ways this war leaves its mark!”</p>

<p>He picked up the flask, poured a liberal measure of its
contents into his own cup, drank off the contents with
evident relish and continued:</p>

<p>“What I had in my mind, if you’ll consider it, was a
series of short stories—say a dozen—on the merchant marine
in the war. This is the spring of 1920. Soon no one will
read anything connected with the war, but I think that
time has scarcely come yet. I have fair knowledge of the
subject and yours of course is first hand. What do you
say? I will supply twelve plots or incidents and you will
clothe them with, say, five thousand words each. We shall
sell them to <i>The Strand</i> or some of those monthlies, and
afterwards publish them as a collection in book form.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” Cheyne said as he slowly sipped his coffee.
“The idea’s rather tempting. But I wish I could feel as
sure as you seem to do about my own style. I’m afraid I
don’t believe that it is as good as you pretend.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cheyne,” Parkes answered deliberately, “you may
take my word for it that I know what I am talking about.
I shouldn’t have come to you if I weren’t sure. Very few
people are satisfied with their own work. No matter how
good it is it falls short of the standard they have set in
their minds. It is another case in which the outsider sees
most of the game.”</p>

<p>Cheyne felt attracted by the proposal. He had written
in all seventeen short stories, and of these only three had
been accepted, and those by inferior magazines. If it would
lead to success he would be only too delighted to
collaborate with this pleasant stranger. It wasn’t so much the
money—though he was not such a fool as to make light
of that part of it. It was success he wanted, acceptance of
his stuff by good periodicals, a name and a standing
among his fellow craftsmen.</p>

<p>“Let’s see what it would mean,” he heard Parkes’s voice,
and it seemed strangely faint and distant. “I suppose,
given the synopses, you could finish a couple of tales per
week—say, six weeks for the lot. And with luck we should
sell for £50 to £100 each—say £500 for your six week’s
work, or nearly £100 per week. And there might be any
amount more for the book rights, filming and so on. Does
the idea appeal to you, Mr. Cheyne?”</p>

<p>Cheyne did not reply. He was feeling sleepy. Did the
idea appeal to him? Yes. No. Did it? Did the idea . . . the
idea . . . Drat this sleepiness! What was he thinking of?
Did the idea . . . What idea? . . . He gave up the struggle
and, leaning back in his chair, sank into a profound and
dreamless slumber.</p>

<p>Ages of time passed and Cheyne slowly struggled back
into consciousness. As soon as he was sufficiently awake to
analyze his sensations he realized that his brain was dull
and clouded and his limbs heavy as lead. He was, however,
physically comfortable, and he was content to allow his
body to remain relaxed and motionless and his mind to
dream idly on without conscious thought. But his energy
gradually returned and at last he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>He was lying, dressed, on a bed in a strange room.
Apparently it was night, for the room was dark save for
the light on the window blind which seemed to come from
a street lamp without. Vaguely interested, he closed his
eyes again, and when he reopened them the room was
lighted up and a man was standing beside the bed.</p>

<p>“Ah,” the man said, “you’re awake. Better, I hope?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Cheyne answered, and it seemed to him
as if some one else was speaking. “Have I been ill?”</p>

<p>“No,” the man returned, “Not that I know of. But
you’ve slept like a log for nearly six hours.”</p>

<p>This was confusing. Cheyne paused to take in the idea,
but it eluded him, then giving up the effort, he asked
another question.</p>

<p>“Where am I?”</p>

<p>“In the Edgecombe: the Edgecombe Hotel, you know,
in Plymouth. I am the manager.”</p>

<p>Ah, yes! It was coming back to him. He had gone there
for lunch—was it today or a century ago?—and he had
met that literary man—what was his name? He couldn’t
remember. And they had had lunch and the man had
made some suggestion about his writing. Yes, of course! It
was all coming back now. The man had wanted to
collaborate with him. And during the conversation he had
suddenly felt sleepy. He supposed he must have fallen
asleep then, for he remembered nothing more. But why
had he felt sleepy like that? Suddenly his brain cleared
and he sat up sharply.</p>

<p>“What’s happened, Mr. Jesse? I never did anything like
this before!”</p>

<p>“No?” the manager answered. “I dare say not. I’ll tell
you what has happened to you, Mr. Cheyne, though I’m
sorry to have to admit it could have taken place in my
hotel. You’ve been drugged. That’s what has happened.”</p>

<p>Cheyne stared incredulously.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” he ejaculated. “Drugged! By—not by
that literary man, surely?” He paused in amazed
consternation and then his hand flew to his pocket. “My money,”
he gasped. “I had over £100 in my pocket. Just got it at
the bank.” He drew out a pocket-book and examined it
hurriedly. “No,” he went on more quietly. “It’s all right.”
He took from it a bundle of notes and with care counted
them. “A hundred and eight pounds. That’s quite correct.
My watch? No, it’s here.” He got up unsteadily, and rapidly
went through his pockets. “Nothing missing anyway. Are
you sure I was drugged? I don’t understand the thing a
little bit.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid there is no doubt about it. You seemed so
ill that I sent for a doctor. He said you were suffering
from the effects of a drug, but were in no danger and
would be all right in a few hours. He advised that you be
left quietly to sleep it off.”</p>

<p>Cheyne rubbed his hand over his eyes.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” he repeated. “Tell me exactly
what happened.”</p>

<p>“About three o’clock or shortly before it, Mr. Parkes
appeared at the office and asked for his bill. He paid it,
complimented the clerk on the excellent lunch he had had,
and left the hotel. He was perfectly calm and collected
and quite unhurried. Shortly after the waiter went up to
clear away the things and he found you lying back in your
chair, apparently asleep, but breathing so heavily that he
was uneasy and he came and told me. I went up at once
and was also rather alarmed at your condition, so I sent
at once for the doctor.”</p>

<p>“But,” Cheyne objected, “that’s all right, only I <em>wasn’t</em>
drugged. I know exactly what I ate and drank, and Parkes
had precisely the same. If I was drugged, he must have
been also, and you say he wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“He certainly was not. But think again, Mr. Cheyne.
Are you really quite certain that he had no opportunity of
putting powder over your food or liquid into your drink?
Did he divert your attention at any time from the table?”</p>

<p>Cheyne was silent. He had remembered the flask of old
brandy.</p>

<p>“He put cognac in my coffee from his own flask,” he
admitted at length, “but it couldn’t have been that.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” the manager answered in a satisfied tone, “it <em>was</em>
that, I should swear. Why don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you why I don’t think so; why, in fact, I know
it wasn’t. He put an even larger dose out of the same flask
into his own cup and he drank his coffee before I drank
mine. So that if there was anything in the flask he would
have got knocked over first.”</p>

<p>The manager looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“Don’t think me discourteous, Mr. Cheyne, but I confess
I have my doubts about that. That episode of the flask
looks too suspicious. Are you sure it was the same flask in
each case? Did he pour straight into one cup after the
other or was there an interval in between? You realize of
course that a clever conjurer could substitute a second
flask for the first without attracting your notice?”</p>

<p>“I realize that right enough, but I am positive he didn’t
do so in this case. Though,” he paused for a moment,
“that reminds me that there was an interval between
pouring into each cup. He got a fit of coughing after giving
me mine and had to put down the flask. But when the
paroxysm was over he lifted it again and helped himself.”</p>

<p>“There you are,” the manager declared. “During his fit
of coughing he substituted a different flask.”</p>

<p>“I’ll swear he didn’t. But can’t we settle the thing
beyond doubt? Have the cups been washed? If not, can’t
we get the dregs analyzed?”</p>

<p>“I have already asked the doctor to have it done. He
said he would get Mr. Pringle to do it at once: that’s the
city analyst. They’re close friends, and Mr. Pringle would
do it to oblige him. We should have his report quite soon.
I am also having him analyze the remains on the plates
which were used. Fortunately, owing to lunch being served
in a private room, these had been stacked together and
none had been washed. So we should be able to settle the
matter quite definitely.”</p>

<p>Cheyne nodded as he glanced at his watch. “Good
Lord!” he cried, “it’s eight o’clock and I said I should be
home by seven! I must ring up my mother or she’ll think
something is wrong.”</p>

<p>The Cheynes had not themselves a telephone, but their
nearest neighbors, people called Hazelton, were
good-natured about receiving an occasional message through
theirs and transmitting it to Warren Lodge. Cheyne went
down to the lounge and put through his call, explaining
to Mrs. Hazelton that unforeseen circumstances had
necessitated his remaining overnight in Plymouth. The lady
promised to have the message conveyed to Mrs. Cheyne
and Maxwell rang off. Then as he turned to the dining
room, a page told him that the manager would like to see
him in his office.</p>

<p>“I’ve just got a report from the doctor about that
coffee, Mr. Cheyne,” the other greeted him, “and I must
say it confirms what you say, though it by no means clears
up the mystery. There was brandy in those cups, but no
drug: no trace of a drug in either.”</p>

<p>“I knew that,” Cheyne rejoined. “Everything that I had
for lunch Parkes had also. I was there and I ought to
know. But it’s a bit unsettling, isn’t it? Looks as if my
heart or something had gone wrong.”</p>

<p>The manager looked at him more seriously. “Oh, I don’t
think so,” he dissented. “I don’t think you can assume
that. The doctor seemed quite satisfied. But if it would
ease your mind, why not slip across now and see him? He
lives just round the corner.”</p>

<p>Cheyne reflected.</p>

<p>“I’ll do so,” he answered presently. “If there’s nothing
wrong it will prevent me fancying things, and if there is
I should know of it. I’ll have some dinner and then go
across. By the way, have you said anything to the police?”</p>

<p>The manager hesitated.</p>

<p>“No, I have not. I don’t know that we’ve evidence
enough. But in any case, Mr. Cheyne, I trust you do not
wish to call in the police.” The manager seemed quite
upset by the idea and spoke earnestly. “It would not do
the hotel any good if it became known that a visitor had
been drugged. I sincerely trust, sir, that you can see your
way to keep the matter quiet.”</p>

<p>Cheyne stared.</p>

<p>“But you surely don’t suggest that I should take the
thing lying down? If I have been drugged, as you say, I
must know who has done it, and why. That would seem
to me obvious.”</p>

<p>“I agree,” the manager admitted, “and I should feel
precisely the same in your place. But it is not necessary to
apply to the police. A private detective would get you the
information quite as well. See here, Mr. Cheyne, I will
make you an offer. If you will agree to the affair being
hushed up, I will employ the detective on behalf of the
hotel. He will work under your direction and keep you
advised of every step he takes. Come now, sir, is it a
bargain?”</p>

<p>Cheyne did not hesitate.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” he said promptly, “that will suit me all right.
I don’t specially want to advertise the fact that I have
been made a fool of. But I’d like to know what has really
happened.”</p>

<p>“You shall, Mr. Cheyne. No stone shall be left unturned
to get at the truth. I’ll see about a detective at once.
You’ll have some dinner, sir?”</p>

<p>Cheyne was not hungry, but he was very thirsty, and he
had a light meal with a number of long drinks. Then he
went round to see the doctor, to whom the manager had
telephoned, making an appointment.</p>

<p>After a thorough examination he received the verdict.
It was a relief to his mind, but it did not tend to clear up
the mystery. He was physically perfectly sound, and his
sleep of the afternoon was not the result of disease or
weakness. He had been drugged. That was the beginning
and the end of the affair. The doctor was quite emphatic
and ridiculed the idea of any other explanation.</p>

<p>Cheyne returned to the Edgecombe, and sitting down
in a deserted corner of the lounge, tried to puzzle the
thing out. But the more he thought of it, the more
mysterious it became. His mind up till then had been
concentrated on the actual administration of the drug, and
this point alone still seemed to constitute an insoluble
problem. But now he saw that it was but a small part of
the mystery. <em>Why</em> had he been drugged? It was not
robbery. Though he had over £100 in his pocket, the money
was intact. He had no other valuables about him, and in
any case nothing had been removed from his pockets. It
was not to prevent his going to any place. He had not
intended to do anything that afternoon that could
possibly interest a stranger. No, he could form no conception
of the motive.</p>

<p>But even more puzzling than this was the question:
How did Parkes, if that was really his name, know that
he, Cheyne, was coming to Plymouth that day? It was
true that he had mentioned it to his mother and sister a
couple of days previously, but he had told no one else and
he felt sure that neither had they. But the man had almost
certainly been expecting him. At least it was hard to
believe that the whole episode had been merely the fruits
of a chance encounter. On the other hand there was the
difficulty that any other suggestion seemed even more
unlikely. Parkes simply <em>couldn’t</em> have known that he,
Cheyne, was coming. It was just inconceivable.</p>

<p>He lay back in his deep armchair, the smoke of his pipe
curling lazily up, as he racked his brains for some theory
which would at least partially meet the facts. But without
success. He could think of nothing which threw a gleam
of light on the situation.</p>

<p>And then he made a discovery which still further
befogged him and made him swear with exasperation.
He had taken out his pocket-book and was once more
going through its contents to make absolutely sure
nothing was missing, when he came to a piece of folded paper
bearing memoranda about the money matters which he
had discussed with his banker. He had not opened this
when he had looked through the book after regaining
consciousness, but now half absent-mindedly he unfolded it.
As he did so he stared. Near the crease was a slight tear,
unquestionably made by some one unfolding it hurriedly
or carelessly. But that tear had not been there when he
had folded it up. He could swear to it. Someone therefore
had been through his pockets while he was asleep.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch02">

<h2>Chapter II. <br/> Burglary!</h2>

<p>The discovery that his pockets had been gone through
while he was under the influence of the drug reduced
Cheyne to a state of even more complete mystification
than ever. What <em>had</em> the unknown been looking for? He,
Cheyne, had nothing with him that, so far as he could
imagine, could possibly have interested any other person.
Indeed, money being ruled out, he did not know that he
possessed anywhere any paper or small object which it
would be worth a stranger’s while to steal.</p>

<p>Novels he had read recurred to him in which desperate
enterprises were undertaken to obtain some document of
importance. Plans of naval or military inventions which
would give world supremacy to the power possessing them
were perhaps the favorite instruments in these romances,
but treaties which would mean war if disclosed to the
wrong power, maps of desert islands on which treasure
was buried, wills of which the existence was generally
unknown and letters compromising the good name of
wealthy personages had all been used time and again. But
Cheyne had no plans or treaties or compromising letters
from which an astute thief might make capital. Think as he
would, he could frame no theory to account for Parkes’s
proceedings.</p>

<p>He yawned and, getting up, began to pace the deserted
lounge. The effects of the drug had not entirely worn off,
for though he had slept all the afternoon he still felt slack
and drowsy. In spite of its being scarcely ten o’clock, he
thought he would have a whisky and go up to bed, in the
hope that a good night’s rest would drive the poison out of
his system and restore his usual feeling of mental and
physical well-being.</p>

<p>But Fate, once more in the guise of an approaching
page, decreed otherwise. As he turned lazily towards the
bar a voice sounded in his ear.</p>

<p>“Wanted on the telephone, sir.”</p>

<p>Cheyne crossed the hall and entered the booth.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said shortly. “Cheyne speaking.”</p>

<p>A woman’s voice replied, a voice he recognized. It
belonged to Ethel Hazelton, the grown-up daughter of that
Mrs. Hazelton whom he had asked to inform Mrs.
Cheyne of his change of plans. She spoke hurriedly and he
could sense perturbation in her tones.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Cheyne, I’m afraid I have rather disturbing
news for you. When you rang up we sent James over to
Warren Lodge. He found Mrs. Cheyne and Agatha on the
doorstep trying to get in. They had been ringing for some
time, but could not attract attention. He rang also, and
then eventually found a ladder and got in through one of
the upper windows. He opened the door for Mrs. Cheyne
and Agatha. Can you hear me all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, clearly. Go on, please, Miss Hazelton.”</p>

<p>“They searched the house and they discovered cook and
Susan in their bedrooms, both tied up and gagged, but
otherwise none the worse. They released them, of course,
and then found that the house had been burgled.”</p>

<p>“Burgled!” Cheyne ejaculated sharply. “Great Scott!”
He was considerably startled and paused in some
consternation, asking then if much stuff was missing.</p>

<p>“They don’t know,” the distant voice answered. “Your
safe had been opened, but they hadn’t had time to make
an examination when James left. The silver seems to be
all there, so that’s something. James came back here with
a message from Mrs. Cheyne asking us to let you know,
and I have been ringing up hotels in Plymouth for the last
half hour. You know, you only said you were staying the
night in your message; you didn’t say where. Mrs. Cheyne
would like you to come back if you can manage it.”</p>

<p>There was no hesitation about Cheyne’s reply.</p>

<p>“Of course I shall,” he said quickly. “I’ll start at once
on my bicycle. What about telling the police?”</p>

<p>“I rang them up immediately. They said they would go
out at once. James has gone back also. He will stay and
lend a hand until you arrive.”</p>

<p>“Splendid! It’s more than good of you both, Miss
Hazelton. I can’t thank you enough. I’ll be there in less
than an hour.”</p>

<p>He delayed only to tell the news to the manager.</p>

<p>“There’s the explanation of this afternoon’s affair at all
events,” he declared. “I was evidently fixed up so that I
couldn’t butt in and spoil sport. But it’s good-bye to your
keeping it quiet. The police have been called in already
and the whole thing is bound to come out.”</p>

<p>The manager made a gesture of concern.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear your news,” he said gravely. “Are
you properly insured?”</p>

<p>“Partially. I don’t know if it will cover the loss because
I don’t know what’s gone. But I must be getting away.”</p>

<p>He was moving off, but the manager laid a detaining
hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m extremely sorry about it. But see here, Mr.
Cheyne, it may not prove to be necessary to bring in about
the drugging. It would injure the hotel. I sincerely trust
you’ll do what you can in the matter, and if you find the
private detective sufficient, you’ll let our arrangement
stand.”</p>

<p>“I’ll decide when I hear just what has happened. You’ll
let me have a copy of the analyst’s report?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Directly I get it I shall send it on.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later Cheyne was passing through the
outskirts of Plymouth on his way east. The night was fine,
the mists of the day having cleared away, and a
three-quarter moon shone brilliantly out of a blue-black sky.
Keenly anxious to reach home and learn the details of the
burglary and the extent of his loss, Cheyne crammed on
every ounce of power, and his machine snored along the
deserted road at well over forty miles an hour. In spite of
slacks for villages and curves he made a record run,
turning into the gate of Warren Lodge at just ten minutes
before eleven.</p>

<p>As he approached the house everything looked normal.
But when he let himself in this impression was dispelled,
for a constable stood in the hall, who, saluting, informed
him that Sergeant Kirby was within and in charge.</p>

<p>But Cheyne’s first concern was with his mother and
sister. An inquiry produced the information that the two
ladies were waiting for him in the drawing room, and
thither he at once betook himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cheyne was a frail little woman who looked ten
years older than her age of something under sixty. She
welcomed her son with a little cry of pleasure.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am relieved to see you, Maxwell,” she cried.
“I’m so glad you were able to come. Isn’t this a terrible
business?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, mother,” Cheyne answered cheerily,
“that depends. I hear no one is any the worse. Has much
stuff been stolen?”</p>

<p>“Nothing!” Mrs. Cheyne’s tone conveyed the wonder
she evidently felt. “Nothing whatever! Or at least we
can’t find that anything is missing.”</p>

<p>“Unless something may have been taken from your
safe,” Agatha interposed. “Was there much in it?”</p>

<p>“No, only a few pounds and some papers, none valuable
to an outsider.” He glanced at his sister. She was a pretty
girl, tall and dark and in features not unlike himself. Both
the young people had favored the late commander’s side
of the house. He turned towards the door, continuing:
“I’ll go and have a look, and then you can tell me what
has happened.”</p>

<p>The safe was built into the wall in his own sanctum,
“the study,” as his mother persisted in calling it. It had
been taken over with the house when Mrs. Cheyne
bought the little estate. As Cheyne now entered he saw that
its doors were standing open. A tall man in the uniform
of a sergeant of police was stooping over it. He turned as
he heard the newcomer’s step.</p>

<p>“Good-evening sir,” he said in an impressive tone. “This
is a bad business.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I don’t know, sergeant,” Cheyne answered
easily. “If no one has been hurt and nothing has been
stolen it might have been worse.”</p>

<p>The sergeant stared at him with some disfavor.</p>

<p>“There’s not much but what might have been worse,”
he observed oracularly. “But we’re not sure yet that
nothing’s been stolen. Nobody knows what was in this here
safe, except maybe yourself. I’d be glad if you’d have a
look and see if anything is gone.”</p>

<p>There was very little in the safe and it did not take
Cheyne many seconds to go through it. The papers were
tossed about—he could swear someone had turned them
over—but none seemed to have been removed. The small
packet of Treasury notes was intact and a number of gold
and silver medals, won in athletic contests, were all in
evidence.</p>

<p>“Nothing missing there, sergeant,” he declared when he
had finished.</p>

<p>His eye wandered round the room. There was not much
of value in it; one or two silver bowls—athletic trophies
also, a small gold clock of Indian workmanship, a pair of
high-power prism binoculars and a few ornaments were
about all that could be turned into money. But all these
were there, undisturbed. It was true that the glass door of
a locked bookcase had been broken to enable the bolt to
be unfastened and the doors opened, but none of the
books seemed to have been touched.</p>

<p>“What do you think they were after, sir?” the sergeant
queried. “Was there any jewelry in the house that they
might have heard of?”</p>

<p>“My mother has a few trinkets, but I scarcely think you
could dignify them by the name of jewelry. I suppose
these precious burglars have left no kind of clue?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, nothing. Except maybe the girls’ description.
I’ve telephoned that into headquarters and the men will
be on the lookout.”</p>

<p>“Good. Well, if you can wait here a few minutes I’ll
go and send my mother to bed and then I’ll come back
and we can settle what’s to be done.”</p>

<p>Cheyne returned to the drawing room and told his
news. “Nothing’s been taken,” he declared. “I’ve been
through the safe and everything’s there. And nothing
seems to be missing from the room either. The sergeant
was asking about your jewels, mother. Have you looked to
see if they’re all right?”</p>

<p>“It was the first thing I thought of, but they are all in
their places. The cabinet I keep them in was certainly
examined, for everything was left topsy-turvy, but nothing
is missing.”</p>

<p>“Very extraordinary,” Cheyne commented. It seemed to
him more than ever clear that these mysterious thieves were
after some document which they believed he had, though
why they should have supposed he held a valuable
document he could not imagine. But the searching first of his
pockets and then of his safe and house unmistakably
suggested such a conclusion. He wondered if he should
advance this theory, then decided he would first hear what
the others had to say.</p>

<p>“Now, mother,” he went on, “it’s past your bedtime, but
before you go I wish you would tell me what happened to
you. Remember I have heard no details other than what
Miss Hazelton mentioned on the telephone.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cheyne answered with some eagerness, evidently
anxious to relieve her mind by relating her experiences.</p>

<p>“The first thing was the telegram,” she began. “Agatha
and I were sitting here this afternoon. I was sewing and
Agatha was reading the paper—or was it the <i>Spectator</i>,
Agatha?”</p>

<p>“The paper, mother, though that does not really
matter.”</p>

<p>“No, of course it doesn’t matter,” Mrs. Cheyne repeated.
It was evident the old lady had had a shock and found it
difficult to concentrate her attention. “Well, at all events
we were sitting here as I have said, sewing and reading,
when your telegram was brought in.”</p>

<p>“<em>My</em> telegram?” Cheyne queried sharply. “What
telegram do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, your telegram about Mr. Ackfield, of course,” his
mother answered with some petulance. “What other
telegram could it be? It did not give us much time, but—”</p>

<p>“But, mother dear, I don’t know what you are talking
about. I sent no telegram.”</p>

<p>Agatha made a sudden gesture.</p>

<p>“There!” she exclaimed eagerly. “What did I say? When
we came home and learned what had happened and
thought of your not turning up,” she glanced at her
brother, “I said it was only a blind. It was sent to get us
away from the house!”</p>

<p>Cheyne shrugged his shoulders good-humoredly. What
he had half expected had evidently taken place.</p>

<p>“Dear people,” he protested, “this is worse than getting
blood from a stone. Do tell me what has happened. You
were sitting here this afternoon when you received a
telegram. Very well now, what time was that?”</p>

<p>“What time? Oh, about—what time did the telegram
come, Agatha?”</p>

<p>“Just as the clock was striking four. I heard it strike
immediately after the ring.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Cheyne in what he imagined was the
manner of a cross-examining K.C. “And what was in the
telegram?”</p>

<p>The girl was evidently too much upset by her experience
to resent his superior tone. She crossed the room, and
taking a flimsy pink form from a table, handed it over to him.</p>

<p>The telegram had been sent out from the General Post
Office in Plymouth at 3:17 that afternoon, and read:</p>

<blockquote><div>

  <p>You and Agatha please come without fail to Newton Abbot by
  5:15 train to meet self and Ackfield about unexpected financial
  development. Urgent that you sign papers today. Ackfield will
  return Plymouth after meeting. You and I will catch 7:10 home
  from Newton Abbot — <span class="signature">Maxwell</span>.</p>

</div></blockquote>

<p>Three-seventeen; and Parkes left the Edgecombe about
three! It seemed pretty certain that he had sent the
telegram. But if so, what an amazing amount the man knew
about them all! Not only had he known of Cheyne’s war
experiences and literary efforts and of his visit that day to
the Edgecombe, but now it seemed that he had also known
his address, of his mother and sister, and, most amazing
thing of all, of the fact that Mr. Ackfield of Plymouth was
their lawyer and confidential adviser! Moreover, he had
evidently known that the ladies were at home as well as
that they alone comprised the family. Surely, Cheyne
thought, comparatively few people possessed all this
knowledge, and the finding of Parkes should therefore be
a correspondingly easy task.</p>

<p>“Extraordinary!” he said aloud. “And what did you do?”</p>

<p>“We got a taxi,” Mrs. Cheyne answered. “Agatha
arranged it by telephone from Mrs. Hazelton’s. You tell
him, Agatha. I’m rather tired.”</p>

<p>The old lady indeed looked worn out and Cheyne
interposed a suggestion that she should go at once to bed,
leaving Agatha to finish the story. But she refused and her
daughter took up the tale.</p>

<p>“We caught the 5:15 ferry and went on to Newton
Abbot. But when the Plymouth train came in there was no
sign of you or Mr. Ackfield, so we sat in the waiting-room
until the 7:10. I telephoned for a taxi to meet the ferry.
It brought us to the door about half-past eight, but
unfortunately it went away before we found we couldn’t get in.”</p>

<p>“You rang?”</p>

<p>“We rang, and knocked, but could get no answer. The
house was in darkness and we began to fear something
was wrong. Then just as I was about to leave mother in
the summer-house and run up to the Hazeltons’ to see if
James was there, he appeared to say that you were staying
in Plymouth overnight. He rang and knocked again. But
still no one came. Then he tried the windows on the
ground floor, but they were all fastened, and at last he got
the ladder from the yard and managed to get in through
the window of your dressing room. He came down and
opened the door and we got in.”</p>

<p>“And what did you find?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at first. We wondered where the maids could
possibly have got to, or what could have happened. I
found your electric torch and we began to search the
rooms. Then we saw that your safe had been broken open
and we knew it was burglary. That terrified us on account
of the maids and we wondered if they had been decoyed
away also. I don’t mind admitting now that I was just
shaking with fear lest we should find that they had been
injured or even murdered. But it wasn’t so bad as that.”</p>

<p>“They were tied up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we found them in cook’s bedroom, lying on the
floor with their hands and feet tied, and gagged. They
were both very weak and could scarcely stand when we
released them. They told us—but you’d better see them
and hear what they have to say. They’re not gone to bed
yet.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll see them directly. What did you do then?”</p>

<p>“As soon as we were satisfied the burglars had gone
James went home to call up the police. Then he came
back and we began a second search to see what had been
stolen. But the more we looked, the more surprised we
became. We couldn’t find that anything had been taken.”</p>

<p>“Extraordinary!” Cheyne commented again. “And
then?”</p>

<p>“After a time the police came out, and then James went
home again to see whether they had been able to get in
touch with you. He came back and told us you would be
here by eleven. He had only just gone when you arrived.
I really can’t say how kind and helpful he has been.”</p>

<p>“Yes, James is a good fellow. Now you and mother get
to bed and I’ll fix things up with the police.”</p>

<p>He turned his steps to the kitchen, where he found the
two maids shivering over a roaring fire and drinking tea.
They stood up as he entered, but he told them to sit down
again, asked for a cup for himself, and seating himself on
the table chatted pleasantly before obtaining their
statements. They had evidently had a bad fright and cook still
seemed hysterical. As he sat he looked at them curiously.</p>

<p>Cook was an elderly woman, small and plain and stout.
She had been with them since they had bought the house,
and though he had not seen much of her, she had always
seemed good-tempered and obliging. He had heard his
mother speak well of her and he was sorry she should have
had so distressing an experience. But he didn’t fancy she
would be one to give burglars much trouble.</p>

<p>Susan, the parlormaid, was of a different quality. She
was tall with rather heavy features, and good looking
after a somewhat coarse type. If a trifle sullen in manner,
she was competent and by no means a fool, and he felt
that nefarious marauders would find her a force to be
reckoned with.</p>

<p>By dint of patient questioning he presently knew all
they had to tell. It appeared that shortly after the ladies
had left a ring had come at the door. Susan had opened it
to find two men standing outside. One was tall and
powerfully built, with dark hair and clean shaven, the
other small and pale—pale face, pale hair, and tiny pale
mustache. They had inquired for Mr. Maxwell Cheyne,
and when she had said he was out the small man had
asked if he could write a note. She had brought them into
the hall and was turning to go for some paper when the
big man had sprung on her and before she could cry out
had pressed a handkerchief over her mouth. The small
man had shut the door and begun to tie her wrists and
ankles. Susan had struggled and in spite of them had
succeeded in getting her mouth free and shouting a warning
to cook, but she had been immediately overpowered and
securely gagged. The men had laid her on the floor of the
hall and had seemed about to go upstairs when cook,
attracted by Susan’s cry, had appeared at the door leading
to the back premises. The two men had instantly rushed
over, and in a few seconds cook also lay bound and
gagged on the floor. They had then disappeared, apparently
to search the house, for in a few minutes they had come
back and carried first Susan and then cook to the latter’s
room at the far end of the back part of the house. The
intruders had then withdrawn, closing the door, and the
two women had neither heard nor seen anything further
of them.</p>

<p>The whole episode had a curious effect on Cheyne. It
seemed, as he considered it, to lose its character of an
ordinary breach of the law, punishable by the authorized
forces of the Crown, and to take on instead that of a
personal struggle between himself and these unknown
men. The more he thought of it the more inclined he
became to accept the challenge and to pit his own brain
and powers against theirs. The mysterious nature of the
affair appealed to his sporting instincts, and by the time
he rejoined the sergeant in the study, he had made up his
mind to keep his own counsel as to the Plymouth incident.
He would call up the manager of the Edgecombe, tell
him to carry on with his private detective, and have the
latter down to Warren Lodge to go into the matter of the
burglary.</p>

<p>He found the sergeant attempting ineffectively to
discover finger-prints on the smooth walls of the safe,
sympathized with him in the difficulty of his task, and asked a
number of deliberately futile questions. On the ground
that nothing had been stolen he minimized the gravity of
the affair, questioned his power to prosecute should the
offenders be forthcoming, and instilled doubts into the
other’s mind as to the need for special efforts to run them
to earth. Finally, the man explaining that he had finished
for the time being, he bade him good night, locked up the
house and went to bed. There he lay for several hours
tossing and turning as he puzzled over the affair, before
sleep descended to blot out his worries and soothe his
eager desire to be on the track of his enemies.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch03">

<h2>Chapter III. <br/> The Launch “Enid”</h2>

<p>For several days after the attempted burglary events in the
Cheyne household pursued the even tenor of their way.
Cheyne went back to Plymouth on the following morning
and interviewed the manager of the Edgecombe, and the
day after a quiet, despondent-looking man with the air of
a small shopkeeper arrived at Warren Lodge and was
closeted with Cheyne for a couple of hours. Mr. Speedwell,
of Horton and Lavender’s Private Detective Agency,
listened with attention to the tales of the drugging and the
burglary, thenceforward appearing at intervals and making
mysterious inquiries on his own account.</p>

<p>On one of these visits he brought with him the report of
the analyst relative to the dishes of which Cheyne had
partaken at lunch, but this document only increased the
mystification the affair had caused. No trace of drugs was
discernible in any of the food or drink in question, and as
the soiled plates or glasses or cups of <em>all</em> the courses were
available for examination, the question of how the drug
had been administered—or alternatively whether it really
had been administered—began to seem almost insoluble.
The cocktail taken with Parkes before lunch was the only
item of which a portion could not be analyzed, but the
evidence of the barmaid proved conclusively that Parkes
could not have tampered with it.</p>

<p>But in spite of the analysis, the coffee still seemed the
doubtful item. Cheyne’s sleepy feeling had come on very
rapidly immediately after drinking the coffee, before which
he had not felt the slightest abnormal symptoms. Mr.
Speedwell laid stress on this point, though he was
pessimistic about the whole affair.</p>

<p>“They know what they’re about, does this gang,” he
admitted ruefully as he and Cheyne were discussing
matters. “That man in the hotel that called himself Parkes—if
we found him tomorrow we should have precious little
against him. However he managed it, we can’t prove he
drugged you. In fact it’s the other way round. He can
prove on our evidence that he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“It looks like it. You haven’t been able to find out
anything about him?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, sir; that is, not what would be any use.
I can prove that he sent your telegram all right; the girl
in the Post Office recognized his description. But I couldn’t
get on to his trail after that. I’ve tried the stations and
the docks and the posting establishments and the hotels
and I can’t get a trace. But of course I’ll maybe get it yet.”</p>

<p>“What about the address given on his card?”</p>

<p>“Tried that first thing. No good. No one of the name
known in the district.”</p>

<p>“When did the man arrive at the hotel?”</p>

<p>“Just after you did, Mr. Cheyne. He probably picked you
up somewhere else and was following you to see where
you’d get lunch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that explains something. I was wondering
how he knew I was going to the Edgecombe.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t explain so very much, sir. Question still is,
how did he get all that other information about you; the
name of your lawyer and so on?”</p>

<p>Cheyne had to admit that the prospects of clearing up
the affair were not rosy. “But what about the burglary?”
he went on more hopefully. “That should be an easier nut
to crack.”</p>

<p>Speedwell was still pessimistic.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, sir,” he answered gloomily.
“There’s not much to go on there either. The only chance
is to trace the men’s arrival or departure. Now individually
the private detective is every bit as good as the police;
better, in fact, because he’s not so tied up with red tape.
But he hasn’t their organization. In a case like this, when
the police with their enormous organization have failed,
the private detective hasn’t a big chance. However, of
course I’ve not given up.”</p>

<p>He paused, and then drawing a little closer to Cheyne
and lowering his voice, he went on impressively: “You
know, sir, I hope you’ll not consider me out of place in
saying it, but I had hoped to get my best clue from
yourself. There can be no doubt that these men are after some
paper that you have, or that they think you have. If you
could tell me what it was, it might make all the
difference.”</p>

<p>Cheyne made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>“Don’t I know that,” he cried. “Haven’t I been racking
my brains over that question ever since the thing
happened! I can’t think of anything. In fact, I can tell you
there <em>was</em> nothing—nothing that I know of anyway,” he
added helplessly.</p>

<p>Speedwell nodded and a sly look came into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, if you can’t tell, you can’t, and that’s all there
is to it.” He paused as if to refer to some other matter,
then apparently thinking better of it, concluded: “You
have my address, and if anything should occur to you I
hope you’ll let me know without delay.”</p>

<p>When Speedwell had taken his departure Cheyne sat on
in the study, thinking over the problem the other had
presented, but as he did so he had no idea that before
that very day was out he should himself have received
information which would clear up the point at issue, as
well as a good many of the other puzzling features of the
strange events in which he had become involved.</p>

<p>Shortly after lunch, then, on this day, the eighth after
the burglary and drugging, Cheyne, on re-entering the
house after a stroll round the garden, was handed a card
and told that the owner was waiting to see him in his
study. Mr. Arthur Lamson, of 17 Acacia Terrace, Bland
Road, Devonport, proved to be a youngish man of middle
height and build, with the ruggedly chiselled features
usually termed hard-bitten, a thick black toothbrush
mustache, and glasses. Cheyne was not particularly
prepossessed by his appearance, but he spoke in an educated way
and had the easy polish of a man of the world.</p>

<p>“I have to apologize for this intrusion, Mr. Cheyne,” he
began in a pleasant tone, “but the fact is I wondered
whether I could interest you in a small invention of mine.
I got your name from Messrs. Holt &amp; Stavenage, the
Plymouth ship chandlers. They told me you dealt with
them and how keen you were on yachting, and as my
invention relates to the navigation of coasting craft, I hoped
you might allow me to show it to you.”</p>

<p>Cheyne, who had had some experience of inventors during
six weeks’ special naval war service after his
convalescence, made a noncommittal reply.</p>

<p>“I may tell you at once, sir,” Mr. Lamson went on,
“that I am looking for a keen amateur who would be
willing to allow me to fit the device to his boat, and who
would be sufficiently interested to test it under all kinds of
varying conditions. You see, though the thing works all
right on a motor launch I have borrowed, I have exhausted
my leave from my business, and am therefore unable to
give it a sufficiently lengthy and varying test to find out
whether it will work continuously under ordinary everyday
sea-going conditions. If it proves satisfactory I believe it
would sell, and if so I should of course be willing to take
into partnership to a certain extent anyone who had
helped me to develop it.”</p>

<p>In spite of himself Cheyne was impressed. This man was
different from those with whom he had hitherto come in
contact. He was not asking for money, or at least he hadn’t
so far.</p>

<p>“Have you patented the device?” he asked, reckoning
willingness to spend money on patent fees a test of good
faith.</p>

<p>“No, not yet,” the visitor answered. “I have taken out
provisional protection, which will cover the thing for four
months more. If it promises well after a couple of months’
test it will be time enough to apply for the full patent.”</p>

<p>Cheyne nodded. This was a reasonable and proper
course.</p>

<p>“What is the nature of the device?” he asked.</p>

<p>The young man’s manner grew more alert. He leaned
forward in his chair and spoke eagerly. Cheyne frowned
involuntarily as he recognized the symptoms.</p>

<p>“It’s a position indicator. It would, I think, be useful at
all times, but during fog it would be simply invaluable:
that is, for coasting work, you know. It would be no good
for protection against collision with another ship. But for
clearing a headland or making a harbor in a fog it would
be worth its weight in gold. The principle is, I believe,
old, but I have been lucky enough to hit on improvements
in detail which get over the defects of previous
instruments. Speaking broadly, a fixed pointer, which may if
desired carry a pen, rests on a moving chart. The chart is
connected to a compass and to rollers operated by devices
for recording the various components of motion: one is
driven off the propeller, others are set, automatically
mostly, for such things as wind, run of tide, wave motion
and so on. The pointer always indicates the position of the
ship, and as the ship moves, the chart moves to correspond.
Steering then resolves itself into keeping the pointer on
the correct line on the chart, and this can be done by
night without guide lamps, or in a fog, as well as in
daytime. The apparatus would also assist navigation through
unbuoyed channels over covered mud flats, or in time of
war through charted mine fields. I don’t want to be a
nuisance to you, Mr. Cheyne, but I do wish you would at
least let me show you the device. You could then decide
whether you would allow me to fix it to your yacht for
experimental purposes.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see it,” Cheyne admitted. “If you can
do all you claim, I certainly think you have a good thing.
Where is it to be seen?”</p>

<p>“On my launch, or rather, the launch I have borrowed.”
The young man’s eagerness now almost approached
excitement. His eyes sparkled and he fidgeted in his chair. “She
is lying off Johnson’s boat slip at Dartmouth. I left the
dinghy there.”</p>

<p>“And you want me to go now?”</p>

<p>“If you really will be so kind. I should propose a short
run down the estuary and along the coast towards
Exmouth, say for two or three hours. Could you spare so
much time?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I should enjoy it. I shall be back, say,
between six and seven.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have you back at Johnson’s slip at six o’clock. I have
a taxi waiting now, and I’ll arrange with Johnson to call
another for you as soon as he sees us coming up the
estuary.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” said Cheyne. “Just a moment until I tell my
people and get a coat.”</p>

<p>The day was ideal for the run. Spring was in the air.
The brilliant April sun poured down from an almost
cloudless sky, against which the sea horizon showed a hard,
sharp line of intensest blue. Within the estuary it was calm,
but multitudinous white flecks in the distance showed a
stiff breeze was blowing out at sea. Cheyne’s spirits rose.
It was a glorious sport, this of battling with the foaming,
tumbling waves in the open. How he loved their blue-black
depth with its suggestion of utter and absolute cleanness,
the creamy purity of their seething crests, their steady,
irresistible onward movement, the restless dancing and
swirling of the wavelets on their flanks! To him it was life to
feel the buoyant spring of the craft beneath him, to hear
the crash of the bows into the troughs and the smack of
the spindrift striking aft. He was glad this Lamson had
called. Even if the matter of the invention was a washout,
as he more than half expected, he felt he was going to
enjoy his afternoon.</p>

<p>Three or four minutes brought them to Johnson’s boat
slip on the outskirts of Dartmouth. There Lamson drew
the proprietor aside.</p>

<p>“See here,” he directed, “we’re going out for a run. I
want you to keep a lookout for us coming back. We shall
be in about six. As soon as you see us send for a taxi and
have it here when we get ashore. Now, Mr. Cheyne, if
you’re ready.”</p>

<p>They climbed down into a small dinghy and Lamson,
taking the oars, pulled out towards a fair-sized motor
launch which lay at anchor some couple of hundred yards
from the shore. She was not a graceful boat, but looked
strongly built, showing a high bluff bow, a square stern
and lines suggestive of speed.</p>

<p>“A sea boat,” said Cheyne approvingly. “You surely
don’t run her by yourself?”</p>

<p>“No, a motoring friend has been giving me a hand. I am
skipper and he engineer. We hug the coast, you know, and
don’t go out if it is blowing.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he pulled round the stern of the launch
upon which Cheyne observed the words “Enid, Devonport.”
At the same time a tall, well-built figure appeared
and waved his hand. Lamson brought the dinghy up to
the tiny steps and a moment later they were on deck.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cheyne has come out to see the great invention,
Tom. I almost hope that he is interested. My friend, Tom
Lewisham, Mr. Cheyne.”</p>

<p>The two men shook hands.</p>

<p>“Lamson thinks he is going to make his fortune with
this thing, Mr. Cheyne,” the big man remarked, smiling.
“We must see that there is no mistake about our
percentages.”</p>

<p>“If you want a percentage you must work for it, my
son,” Lamson declared. “Mr. Cheyne must be back by six,
so get your old rattletrap going and we’ll run down to the
sea. If you don’t mind, Mr. Cheyne, we’ll get under way
before I show you the machine, as it takes both of us to
get started.”</p>

<p>“Right-o,” said Cheyne. “I’ll bear a hand if there’s
anything I can do.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s good of you. It would be a help if you
would take the tiller while I’m making all snug. There’s
a bit of a tumble on outside.”</p>

<p>The boat was certainly a flier. The charmingly situated
old town dropped rapidly astern while Lamson “made
snug.” Then he came aft, shouted down through the
engine room skylight for his friend, and when the latter
appeared told him to take the tiller.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Cheyne,” he went on, “now comes the great
moment! I have not fixed the apparatus up here in front
of the tiller, partly to keep it secret and partly to save the
trouble of making it weatherproof. It’s down in the cabin.
But you understand it should be up here. Will you come
down?”</p>

<p>He led the way down a companion to a diminutive
saloon. “It’s in the sleeping part, still forward,” he pointed,
and the two men squeezed through a door in the bulkhead
into a tiny cabin, lit by electric light and with a table in
the center and two berths on either side. On the table was
a frame on the top of which was stretched a chart, and a
light rod ran out from one side to a pointer fixed over the
middle of the chart.</p>

<p>“You can see that it’s very roughly made,” Lamson went
on, “but if you look closely I think you’ll find that it works
all right.”</p>

<p>Cheyne bent forward and examined the machine, and
as he did so mystification grew in his mind. The chart was
not of the estuary of the Dart, nor, stranger still, was it
connected to rollers. It was simply tacked on what he now
saw was merely the lid of a box. How it was moved he
couldn’t see.</p>

<p>“I don’t follow this,” he said. “How do you get your
chart to move if it’s nailed down?”</p>

<p>There was no answer, but as he swung round with a
sudden misgiving there was a sharp click. Lamson had
disappeared and the door was shut!</p>

<p>Cheyne seized the handle and turned it violently, only
to find that the bolt of the lock had been shot, but before
he could attempt further researches the light went off,
leaving him in almost pitch darkness. At the same moment
a significant lurch showed that they were passing from the
shelter of the estuary into the open sea.</p>

<p>He twisted and tugged at the handle. “Here you,
Lamson!” he shouted angrily. “What do you mean by this?
Open the door at once. Confound you! Will you open the
door!” He began to kick savagely at the woodwork.</p>

<p>A small panel in the partition between the cabins shot
aside and a beam of light flowed into Cheyne’s. Lamson’s
face appeared at the opening. He spoke in an old-fashioned,
stilted way, aping extreme politeness, but his
mocking smile gave the lie to his protestations.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Cheyne, for this incivility,” he declared,
“and hope that when you have heard my explanation you
will pardon me. I must admit I have played a trick on you
for which I offer the fullest apologies. The story of my
invention was a fabrication. So far as I am aware no
apparatus such as I have described exists: certainly I have not
made one. The truth is that you can do me a service, and
I took the liberty of inveigling you here in the hope of
securing your good offices in the matter.”</p>

<p>“You’ve taken a bad way of getting my help,” Cheyne
shouted wrathfully. “Open the door at once, damn you, or
I’ll smash it to splinters!”</p>

<p>The other made a deprecatory gesture.</p>

<p>“Really I beg of you, Mr. Cheyne,” he said in mock
horror at the other’s violence. “Not so fast, if you please,
sir. I have an answer to both your observations. With
regard to the door you will—”</p>

<p>Cheyne interrupted him with a savage oath and a fierce
onslaught of kicks on the lower panels of the door. But he
could make no impression on them, and when in a few
moments he paused breathless, Lamson went on quietly.</p>

<p>“With regard to the door, as I was about to observe, it
would be a waste of energy to attempt to smash it to
splinters, because I have taken the precaution to have it
covered with steel plates. They are bolted through and the
nuts are on the outside. I mention this to save you—”</p>

<p>Cheyne was by this time almost beside himself with rage.
He expressed his convictions and desires as to Lamson and
his future in terms which from the point of view of force
left little to be desired, and persistently reiterated his
demand that the door be opened as a prelude to further
negotiation. In reply Lamson shook his head, and
remarking that as the present seemed an inopportune moment
for discussing the situation, he could postpone the
conversation, he closed the panel and left the inner cabin once
more in darkness.</p>

<p>For an hour Cheyne stormed and fumed, and with
pieces which he managed to knock off the table tried to
break through the door, the bulkheads, and the deadlighted
porthole, all with such a complete absence of success
that when at last Lamson appeared once more at the
panel he was constrained to listen, though with suppressed
fury, to what he had to say.</p>

<p>“You see, it’s this way, Mr. Cheyne,” the erstwhile
inventor began. “You are completely in our power, and the
sooner you realize it and let us come to business, the sooner
you’ll be at liberty again. We don’t wish you any harm;
please accept my assurances on that. All we want is a
slight service at your hands, and when you perform it you
will be free to return home; in fact we shall take you back
as I said, with profuse apologies for your inconvenience
and loss of time. But it is only fair to point out that we
are determined to get what we want, and if you are not
prepared to come to terms now we can wait until you are.”</p>

<p>Cheyne, still at a white heat, cursed the other savagely.
Lamson waited until he had finished, then went on in a
smooth, almost coaxing tone:</p>

<p>“Now do be reasonable, Mr. Cheyne. You must see that
your present attitude is only wasting time for us both.
Not to put too fine a point on it, the situation is this:
You are there, and you can’t get out, and you can’t attract
attention to your predicament—that is why the deadlights
are shipped. It grieves me to say it,” Lamson smiled
sardonically, “but I must tell you that you will stay there
until you do what we want. In order to prevent Mrs.
Cheyne becoming uneasy we shall wire her in your name
that you have left for an extended trip and won’t be back
for some days. ‘To Cheyne, Warren Lodge, Dartmouth.
Gone for yachting cruise down French coast. Address
Poste Restante, St. Nazaire. All well. Maxwell.’ You see,
we know exactly how to word it. All suspicion would be
lulled for some days and then,” he paused and something
sinister and revolting came into his face, “then it wouldn’t
matter, for it would be too late. For you see there is neither
food nor drink in the cabin and we don’t propose to pass
any in. You won’t get any, Mr. Cheyne, no matter how
many days you remain aboard: that is,” his manner
changed, “unless you are reasonable, which of course you
will be. In that case no harm is done. Now won’t you
hear our little proposition?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see you in hell first,” Cheyne shouted, his rage once
again overwhelming him. “You’ll pay for this, I can tell
you. It’ll be the dearest trip you ever had in your life,”
and he proceeded with threats and curses to demand the
immediate opening of the door. Lamson, a whimsical smile
curling his lips, shrugged his shoulders at the outburst,
and replied by withdrawing his head from the opening
and sliding the panel to.</p>

<p>Cheyne, left once more in almost complete darkness, sat
silent, his mind full of wrath against his captors. But as
time passed and they made no sign, his fury somewhat
evaporated and he began to wonder what it was they
wanted with him. His rage had made him thirsty, and the
mere fact that Lamson had stated that nothing would be
given him to drink, made his thirst more insistent. It was
impossible, he said to himself, that the scoundrels could
carry out so diabolical a threat, but in spite of his
assurance, little misgivings began to creep into his mind. At all
events the vision of his usual cup of afternoon tea grew
increasingly alluring. When therefore after what seemed
to him several hours, but what was in reality about forty
minutes only, the panel suddenly opened, he admitted
sullenly that he was prepared to listen to what Lamson had
to say.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” the young man answered heartily. “If
you could just see your way to humor us in this little
matter there is no reason why we should not part friends.”</p>

<p>“There’s no question of friends about it,” Cheyne
declared sharply. “Cut your chatter and get on to business.
What do you want?”</p>

<p>A smile suffused Mr. Lamson’s roughhewn
countenance.</p>

<p>“Now that’s talking,” he cried. “That’s what I’ve been
hoping to hear. I’ll tell you the whole thing and you’ll
see it’s only a mere trifle that we’re asking. I can put it in
five words: We want Arnold Price’s letter.”</p>

<p>Cheyne stared.</p>

<p>“Arnold Price’s letter?” he repeated in amazement.
“What on earth do you know about Arnold Price’s letter?”</p>

<p>“We know all about it, Mr. Cheyne—a jolly sight more
than you do. We know about his giving it to you and the
conditions under which he asked you to keep it. But you
don’t know why he did so or what is in it. We do, and
we can justify our request for it.”</p>

<p>The demand was so unexpected that Cheyne sat for a
moment in silence, thinking how the letter in question had
come into his possession. Arnold Price was a junior officer
in one of the ships belonging to the Fenchurch Street firm
in whose office Cheyne had spent five years as clerk.
Business had brought the two young men in contact during the
visits of Price’s ship, and they had become rather friendly.
On Cheyne’s leaving for Devonshire they had drifted apart,
indeed they had only met on one occasion since. That was
in 1917, shortly before Cheyne received the wound which
invalided him out of the service. Then he found that his
former companion had volunteered for the navy on the
outbreak of hostilities. He had done well, and after a
varied service he had been appointed third officer of
the <i>Maurania</i>, an eight-thousand-ton liner carrying passengers,
as well as stores from overseas to the troops in France.
The two had spent an evening together in Dunkirk
renewing their friendship and talking over old times. Then, two
months later, had come the letter. In it Price asked his
friend to do him a favor. Some private papers, of interest
only to himself, had come into his possession and he wished
these to be safely preserved until after the war. Knowing
that Cheyne was permanently invalided out, he was
venturing to send these papers, sealed in the enclosed envelope,
with the request that Cheyne would keep them for him
until he reclaimed them or until news of his death was
received. In the latter case Cheyne was to open the
envelope and act as he thought fit on the information therein
contained.</p>

<p>The sealed envelope was of a size which would hold a
foolscap sheet folded in four, and was fairly bulky. It was
inscribed: “To Maxwell Cheyne, of Warren Lodge,
Dartmouth, Devonshire, from Arnold Price, third officer,
S.S. <i>Maurania</i>,” and on the top was written: “Please retain
this envelope unopened until I claim it or until you have
received authentic news of my death. Arnold Price.”
Cheyne had acknowledged it, promising to carry out the
instructions, and had then sent the envelope to his bank,
where it had since remained.</p>

<p>The insinuating voice of Lamson broke through his
thoughts.</p>

<p>“I think, Mr. Cheyne, when you hear the reasons for our
request, you will give it all due consideration. For one—”</p>

<p>What? Break faith with Price? Go back on his friend?
Rage again choked Cheyne’s utterance. Stutteringly he
cursed the other, once again demanding under blood-curdling
threats of future vengeance his immediate liberty.
Through his passion he heard the voice of the other saying
he was sorry but he really could not help it, the panel slid
shut, and darkness and silence, save for the sounds of the
sea, reigned in the <i>Enid’s</i> cabin.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch04">

<h2>Chapter IV. <br/> Concerning a Peerage</h2>

<p>When Maxwell Cheyne’s paroxysm of fury diminished
and he began once more to think collectedly about the
unpleasant situation in which he found himself, a startling
idea occurred to him. Here at last, surely, was the
explanation of his previous adventures! The drugging in the hotel
in Plymouth, the burglary at Warren Lodge, and now his
kidnaping on the <i>Enid</i> were all part and parcel of the
same scheme. It was for Price’s letter that his pocketbook
was investigated while he lay asleep in the private room
at the Edgecombe; it was for Price’s letter that his safe
was broken open and his house searched by other members
of the conspiracy, and it was for Price’s letter that he now
lay, a prisoner aboard this infernal launch.</p>

<p>A valuable document, this of Price’s must surely be, if
it was worth such pains to acquire! Cheyne wondered how
it had never occurred to him that it might represent the
motive of the earlier crimes, but he soon realized that he
had never thought of it as being of interest to anyone
other than Price. Indeed, Price himself referred to his
enclosure as “some private papers, of interest to myself
only.” In that last phrase Price had evidently been wrong,
and Cheyne wondered whether he had been genuinely
mistaken, or whether he had from distrust of himself
deliberately misstated the case in order to minimize the value of
the document. Price had certainly not shown himself
anxious to regain it at the earliest possible moment. On
the conclusion of peace he had not accepted demobilization.
He had applied for and obtained a transfer to the
Middle East, where he had commanded one of the
transports plying between Basrah and Bombay in connection
with the Mesopotamian campaign. So far as Cheyne knew,
he was still there. He hadn’t heard of him for many
months, not, indeed, since he went out.</p>

<p>While Cheyne had been turning over these matters in
his mind the launch had evidently been approaching land,
as its rather wild rolling and pitching had gradually ceased
and it was now floating on an even keel. Cheyne had been
conscious of the fact despite his preoccupation, but now
his musings were interrupted by the stopping of the motor
and a few seconds later by the plunge of the anchor and
the rattle of the running chain. In the comparative silence
he shouted himself hoarse, but no one paid him the least
attention. He heard, however, the dinghy being drawn up
to the side and presently the sound of oars retreating, but
whether one or both of his captors had left he could not
tell. In an hour or two the boat returned, but though he
again shouted and beat the door of his cabin, no notice
was taken of his calls.</p>

<p>Then began for Cheyne a period which he could never
afterwards look back on without a shudder. Never could
he have believed that a night could be so long, that time
could drag so slowly. He made himself as comfortable as
he could in one of the bunks, but as the clothes and the
mattress had been removed, his efforts were not crowned
with much success. In spite of his weariness and of the
growing exhaustion due to hunger, he could not sleep.
He wanted something to drink. He was surprised to find
that thirst was not localized in a parched throat or dry
mouth. His whole being cried out for water. He could not
have described the sensation, but it was very intense, and
with every hour that passed it grew stronger. He turned
and tossed in the narrow bunk, his restlessness and
discomfort continually increasing. At last he dozed, but only
to fall into horrible dreams from which he awoke
unrefreshed and thirstier than ever.</p>

<p>Cheyne had plenty of spirit and dash, but he lacked in
staying power, and when the inevitable period of reaction
to his excitement and rage came he became plunged in a
deep depression. These fellows had him in their power. If
this went on and they really carried out their threat he
would have to give way sooner or later. He hated to think
he might betray a trust; he hated still more to be coerced
into doing anything against his own will, but when, as it
seemed to him, weeks later, the panel shot back and
Lamson’s face appeared, his first decision was shaken and
he waited sullenly to hear what the other had to say.</p>

<p>The man was polite and deprecating rather than blustering,
and seemed anxious to make it as easy as possible
for Cheyne to capitulate.</p>

<p>“I hope, Mr. Cheyne,” he began, “you will allow me to
explain this matter more fully, as I cannot but think you
have at least to some extent misunderstood our proposal.
I did not tell you the whole of the facts, but I should like
to do so now if you will listen.”</p>

<p>He paused expectantly. Cheyne glowered at him, but
did not reply, and Lamson resumed:</p>

<p>“The matter is somewhat complicated, but I will do my
best to explain it as briefly as I can. In a word, then, it
relates to a claim for a peerage. I must admit to you that
Lamson is not my name—it is Price, and the Arnold Price
whom you knew during the war is my second cousin.
Arnold’s uncle and my father’s cousin, St. John Price, is,
or rather was, in the diplomatic service, and it is through
his discoveries that the present situation has arisen.</p>

<p>“It happened that this St. John Price had occasion to
visit South Africa on diplomatic business during the war,
and as luck would have it he took his return passage on
the <i>Maurania</i>, the ship on which his nephew Arnold was
third officer. But he never reached England. He met his
death on the journey under circumstances which involved
a coincidence too remarkable to have happened otherwise
than in real life.”</p>

<p>In spite of himself Cheyne was interested. Price glanced
at him and went on:</p>

<p>“One night at the end of the voyage when they were
running without lights up the Channel, a large steamer
going in the same direction as themselves suddenly loomed
up out of the darkness and struck them heavily on the
starboard quarter. My cousin was on deck, though not in
charge. He saw the outlines of the vessel as she was closing
in, and he also saw that a passenger was standing at the
rail just where the contact was about to take place. At the
risk of his own life he sprang forward and dragged the man
back. Unfortunately he was not in time to save him, for a
falling spar broke his back and only just missed killing
Arnold. Then, as you may have guessed from what I said,
it turned out that the passenger was none other than St.
John Price. My cousin had tried to save his own uncle.”</p>

<p>Once more Price paused, but Cheyne still remaining
silent, he continued:</p>

<p>“St. John lingered for some hours, during most of which
time he was conscious, and it was then that he told Arnold
about his belief, that he, Arnold, was heir to the barony of
Hull. I don’t know, Mr. Cheyne, if you are aware that the
present Lord Hull is a man well on to eighty and is in
failing health. He has no known heir, and unless some
claimant comes forward speedily, the title will in the
course of nature become extinct. As you probably know
also, Lord Hull is a man of enormous wealth. St. John Price
believed that he, Arnold, and myself were all descended
from the eldest son of Francis, the fifth Baron Hull. This
man had lived an evil, dissolute life, and England having
become too hot to hold him, he had sailed for South Africa
in the early part of the last century. On his father’s death
search was made for him, but without result, and the
second son, Alwyn, inherited. St. John had after many
years’ labor traced what he believed was a lineal descent
from the scapegrace, and he had utilized his visit to South
Africa to make further inquiries. There he had unearthed
the record of a marriage, which, he believed, completed
the proofs he sought. As he knew he was dying, he handed
over the attested copy of the marriage certificate to Arnold,
at the same time making a new will leaving all the other
documents in the case to Arnold also.</p>

<p>“When Arnold received his next leave he went fully into
the matter with his solicitor, only to find that one
document, the register of a birth, was missing. Without this he
could scarcely hope to win his case. The evidence of the
other papers tended to show that the birth had taken place
in India, probably at Bombay, and Arnold therefore
applied for a transfer into a service which brought him to
that country, in the hope that he would have an opportunity
to pursue his researches at first hand. It was there
that I met him—I am junior partner in Swanson, Reid &amp;
Price’s of that city—and he told me all that I have told
you.</p>

<p>“Before going to the East he sealed up the papers referring
to the matter and sent them to you. If you will pardon
my saying so, I think that there he made a mistake. But he
explained that he knew too much about lawyers to leave
anything in their hands, that they would fight the case for
their own fees whether there was any chance of winning it
or not, and that he wanted the papers to be in the hands of
an honest man in case of his death.</p>

<p>“I pointed out that I was interested in the matter also,
but he said No, that he was the heir and that during his
life the affair concerned him alone. Needless to say, we
parted on bad terms.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Cheyne, you can see why I want those papers.
Though Arnold is my cousin I doubt his honesty. I want
to see exactly how we both stand. I want nothing but what
is fair—as a matter of fact I can get nothing but what is
fair—the law wouldn’t allow it. But I don’t want to be
done. If I had the papers I would show them to a first-rate
lawyer. If Arnold is entitled to succeed he will do so, if I
am the heir I shall, if neither of us no harm is done. We
can only get what the law allows us. But in any case I
give my word of honor that, if I succeed, Arnold shall
never want for anything in reason.”</p>

<p>Price was speaking earnestly and his manner carried
conviction to Cheyne. Without waiting for a reply he
proceeded.</p>

<p>“You, Mr. Cheyne, if you will excuse my saying it, are
an outsider in the matter. Whether Arnold or I or neither
of us succeeds is nothing to you. You want to do only what
is fair to Arnold, and you have my most solemn promise
that that is all I propose. If you enable me to test our
respective positions by handing over the papers to me you
will not be letting Arnold down.”</p>

<p>When Price ceased speaking there was silence between
the two men as Cheyne thought over what he had heard.
Price’s manner was convincing, and as far as Cheyne could
form an opinion, the story might be true. It certainly
explained the facts adequately, and Cheyne believed that
the statements about Lord Hull were correct. All the same
he did not believe this man was out for a square deal. If
he could only get what the law allowed, would not the
same apply whether he or Arnold conducted the affair?
Cheyne, moreover, was still sore from his treatment, and
he determined he would not discuss the matter until he
had received satisfactory replies to one or two personal
questions.</p>

<p>“Did you drug me in the Edgecombe Hotel in Plymouth
a week ago and then go through my pockets, and did you
the same evening burgle my house, break open my safe,
and mishandle my servants?”</p>

<p>It was not exactly a tactful question, but Price answered
it cheerfully and without hesitation.</p>

<p>“Not in person, but I admit my agents did these things.
For these also I am anxious to apologize.”</p>

<p>“Your apologies won’t prevent your having a lengthened
acquaintance with the inside of a prison,” Cheyne snarled,
his rage flickering up at the recollection of his injuries.
“How do your confederates come to be interested?”</p>

<p>“Bought,” the other admitted sweetly. “I had no other
way of getting help. I have paid them twenty pounds on
account and they will get a thousand guineas each if my
claim is upheld.”</p>

<p>“A self-confessed thief and crook as well as a liar! And
you expect me to believe in your good intentions towards
Arnold Price!”</p>

<p>An unpleasant look passed across the other’s face, but
he spoke calmly.</p>

<p>“That may be all very well and very true if you like,
but it doesn’t advance the situation. The question now is:
Are you prepared to hand over the letter? Nothing else
seems to me to matter.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not come to me like an ordinary honest
man and tell me your story? What induced you to launch
out into all this complicated network of crime?”</p>

<p>Price smiled whimsically.</p>

<p>“Well, you might surely guess that,” he answered.
“Suppose you had refused to give me the letter, how was I to
know that you would not have put it beyond my reach?
I couldn’t take the risk.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I refuse to give it to you now?”</p>

<p>“You won’t, Mr. Cheyne. No one in your position could.
Circumstances are too strong for you, and you can hand it
over and retain your honor absolutely untarnished. I do
not wish to urge you to a decision. If you would prefer to
take today to think it over, by all means do so. I sent
the wire to Mrs. Cheyne shortly before six last night, so
she will not be uneasy about you.”</p>

<p>Though the words were politely spoken, the threat
behind them was unmistakable and fell with sinister intent
on the listener’s ears. Rapidly Cheyne considered the
situation. This ruffian was right. No one in such a situation
could resist indefinitely. It was true he could refuse his
consent at the moment, but the question would come up
again and again until at last he would have to give way.
He knew it, and he felt that unless there was a strong
chance of victory, he could not stand the hours of suffering
which a further refusal would entail. No, bitter as the
conclusion was, he felt he must for the moment admit
defeat, trusting later to getting his own back. He turned
back to Price.</p>

<p>“I haven’t got the letter here. I can only get it for you
if you put me ashore.”</p>

<p>That this was a victory for Price was evident, but the
young man showed no elation. He carefully avoided
anything in the nature of a taunt, and spoke in a quiet,
businesslike way.</p>

<p>“We might be able to arrange that. Where is the letter?”</p>

<p>“At my bank in Dartmouth.”</p>

<p>“Then the matter is quite simple. All you have to do is
to write to the manager to send the letter to an address
I shall give you. Directly you do so you shall have the best
food and drink on the launch, and directly the letter is in
our hands you will be put ashore close to your home.”</p>

<p>Cheyne still hesitated.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it provided you can prove to me your statements.
How am I to know that you will keep your word? How
am I to know that you won’t get the letter and then
murder me?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you can’t know that. I would gladly prove
it to you, but you must see that it’s just not possible. I
give you my solemn word of honor and you’ll have to
accept it because there is nothing else you can do.”</p>

<p>Cheyne demurred further, but as Price showed signs of
retreating and leaving him to think it over until the
evening, he hastily agreed to write the letter. Immediately the
electric light came on in his cabin and Price passed in a
couple of sheets of notepaper and envelopes. Cheyne gazed
at them in surprise. They were of a familiar silurian gray
and the sheets bore in tiny blue embossed letters the words
“Warren Lodge, Dartmouth, S. Devon.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s my own paper,” he exclaimed, and Price with
a smile admitted that in view of some development like
the present, his agents had taken the precaution to annex
a few sheets when paying their call to Cheyne’s home.</p>

<p>“If you will ask your manager to send the letter to
Herbert Taverner, Esq., Royal Hotel, Weymouth, it will
meet the case. Taverner is my agent, and as soon as it is
in his hands I will set you ashore at Johnson’s wharf.”</p>

<p>Seeing there was no help for it, Cheyne wrote the letter.
Price read it carefully, then sealed it in its envelope.
Immediately after he handed through the panel a tumbler of
whisky and water, then hurried off, saying he was going
to dispatch the letter and bring Cheyne his breakfast.</p>

<p>Oh, the unspeakable delight of that drink! Cheyne
thought he had never before experienced any sensation
approaching it in satisfaction. He swallowed it in great
gulps, and when in a few moments Price returned, he
demanded more, and again more.</p>

<p>His thirst assuaged, hunger asserted itself, and for the
next half-hour Cheyne had the time of his life as Price
handed in through the panel a plate of smoking ham and
eggs, fragrant coffee, toast, butter, marmalade and the like.
At last with a sigh of relief Cheyne lit his pipe, while Price
passed in blankets and rugs to make up a bed in one of
the bunks. Some books and magazines followed and a handbell,
which Price told him to ring if he wanted anything.</p>

<p>Comfortable in body and fairly easy in mind, Cheyne
made up his bed and promptly fell asleep. It was
afternoon when he awoke, and on ringing the bell, Price
appeared with a well-cooked lunch. The evening passed
comfortably if tediously and that night Cheyne slept well.</p>

<p>Next day and next night dragged slowly away. Cheyne
was well looked after and supplied with everything he
required, but the confinement grew more and more
irksome. However, he could not help himself and he had to
admit he might have fared worse, as he lay smoking in his
bunk and brooding over schemes to get even with the men
who had tricked him.</p>

<p>About half-past ten on the second morning he suddenly
heard oars approaching, followed by the sounds of a boat
coming alongside and some one climbing on board. A few
moments later Price appeared at the panel.</p>

<p>“You will be pleased to hear, Mr. Cheyne, that we have
received the letter safely. We are getting under way at
once and you will be home in less than three hours.”</p>

<p>Presently the motor started, and soon the slow, easy roll
showed they were out in the open breasting the Channel
ground swell. After a couple of hours, Price appeared with
his customary tray.</p>

<p>“We are just coming into the estuary of the Dart,” he
said. “I thought perhaps you would have a bit of lunch
before going ashore.”</p>

<p>The meal, like its fellows, was surprisingly well cooked
and served, and Cheyne did full justice to it. By the time
he had finished the motion of the boat had subsided and
it was evident they were in sheltered waters. Some minutes
later the motor stopped, the anchor was dropped, and
someone got into a boat and rowed off. A quarter of an
hour passed and then the boat returned, and to Cheyne’s
misgivings and growing concern, the motor started again.
But after a very few minutes it once more stopped and
Price appeared at the panel.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Cheyne, the time has come for us to say
good-bye. For obvious reasons I am afraid we shall have
to ask you to row yourself ashore, but the tide is flowing
and you will have no difficulty in that. But before parting
I wish to warn you very earnestly for your own sake and
your own safety not to attempt to follow us or to set the
police on our track. Believe me, I am not speaking idly
when I assure you that we cannot brook interference with
our plans. We wish to avoid ‘removals’,” he lingered over
the word and a sinister gleam came into his eyes, “but
please understand we shall not hesitate if there is no other
way. And if you try to give trouble there will be in your
case no other way. Take my advice and be wise enough
to forget this little episode.” He took a small automatic
pistol from his pocket and balanced it before the panel.
“I warn you most earnestly that if you attempt to make
trouble it will mean your death. And with regard to trying
to follow us, please remember that this launch has the
heels of any craft in the district and that we have a safe
hiding-place not far away.”</p>

<p>As Price finished speaking he unlocked and threw open
the cabin door, motioning his prisoner to follow him on
deck. There Cheyne saw that they were far down the
estuary, in fact, nearly opposite Warren Lodge and a mile or
more from the town.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to take me to Johnson’s
jetty,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“An obvious precaution,” the other returned smoothly.
“I trust you won’t mind.”</p>

<p>The freshness and the freedom of the deck were inexpressibly
delightful to Cheyne after his long confinement in
the stuffy cabin. He stood drawing deep draughts of the
keen invigorating air into his lungs, as he gazed at the
familiar shores of the estuary, lighted up in the brilliant
April sunlight. Nature seemed in an optimistic mood and
Cheyne, in spite of his experiences and Price’s gruesome
remarks, felt optimistic also. He still felt he would devote
all his energies to getting even with the scoundrels who
had robbed him, but he no longer regarded them with a
sullen hatred. Rather the view of the affair as a game in
which he was pitting his wits against theirs gained force
in his mind, and he looked forward with zest to turning
the tables upon them in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>In the launch’s dinghy, which was made fast astern, was
Lewisham, engaged in untying the painter of a second
dinghy which bore on its stern board the words “S.
Johnson, Dartmouth.” The explanation of the starting and
stopping of the motor now became clear. The conspirators
had evidently gone in to pick up this boat and had towed
it down the estuary so as to insure their escape before
Cheyne could reach the shore to lodge any information
against them.</p>

<p>The painter untied, Lewisham passed it aboard the
launch and Price, drawing the boat up to the gunwale,
motioned Cheyne into it.</p>

<p>“As I said, I’m sorry we shall have to ask you to row
yourself ashore, but the run of the tide will help you.
Good-bye, Mr. Cheyne. I deeply regret all the inconvenience
you have suffered, and most earnestly I urge you to
regard the warning which I have given you.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he threw the end of the painter into the
dinghy and, the launch’s motor starting, she drew quickly
ahead, leaving Cheyne seated in the small boat.</p>

<p>Full of an idea which had just flashed into his mind,
the latter seized the oars and began pulling with all his
might not for Johnson’s jetty, but for the shore immediately
opposite. But try as he would, he did not reach it
before the launch <i>Enid</i> had become a mere dot on the
seaward horizon.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch05">

<h2>Chapter V. <br/> An Amateur Sleuth</h2>

<p>Cheyne’s great idea was that instead of proceeding
directly to the police station and lodging an information
against his captors, as he had at first intended, he should
himself attempt to follow them to their lair. To enter upon
a battle of wits with such men would be a sport more
thrilling than big game hunting, more exciting than war,
and if by his own unaided efforts he could bring about
their undoing he would not only restore his self-respect,
which had suffered a nasty jar, but might even recover
for Arnold Price the documents which he required for his
claim to the barony of Hull.</p>

<p>Whether he was wise in this decision was another
matter, but with Maxwell Cheyne impulse ruled rather than
colder reason, the desire of the moment rather than
adherence to calculated plan. Therefore directly a way in which
he could begin the struggle occurred to him, he was all
eagerness to set about carrying it out.</p>

<p>The essence of his plan was haste, and he therefore bent
lustily to his oars, sending the tiny craft bounding over
the wavelets of the estuary and leaving a wake of bubbles
from its foaming stem. In a few minutes he had reached
the shore immediately beneath Warren Lodge, tied the
painter round a convenient boulder, and racing over the
rocky beach, had set off running towards the house.</p>

<p>It was a short though stiff climb, but he did not spare
himself, and he reached the garden wall within three
minutes of leaving the boat. As he turned in through the gate
he looked back over the panorama of sea, the whole
expanse of which was visible from this point, measuring
with his eye the distance to Inner Froward Point, the
headland at the opposite side of the bay, around which
the <i>Enid</i> had just disappeared. She was going east, up channel,
but he did not think she was traveling fast enough to
defeat his plans.</p>

<p>Another minute brought him to the house, and there,
in less time than it takes to tell, he had seen his sister,
explained that he might not be back that night, obtained
some money, donned his leggings and waterproof, and
starting up his motor bike, had set off to ride into
Dartmouth.</p>

<p>Pausing for a moment at the boat slip to tell Johnson of
the whereabouts of his dinghy, he reached the ferry and
got across the river to Kingswear with the minimum of
delay possible. Then once more mounting his machine, he
rode rapidly off towards the east.</p>

<p>The land lying eastward of Dartmouth forms a peninsula
shaped roughly like an inverted cone, truncated, and
connected to the mainland by a broad isthmus at the
northwest corner. The west side is bounded by the river
Dart, with Dartmouth and Kingswear to the southwest,
while on the other three sides is the sea. Brixham is a
small town at the northeast corner, while further north
beyond the isthmus are the larger towns of Paignton and,
across Tor Bay, Torquay.</p>

<p>Most of the ground on the peninsula is high, and the
road from Kingswear in the southwest corner to Brixham
in the northeast crosses a range of hills from which a good
view of Tor Bay and the sea to the north and east is
obtainable. Should the <i>Enid</i> have been bound for Torquay,
Teignmouth, Exmouth, or any of the seaports close by,
she would pass within view of this road, whereas if she
was going right up Channel past Portland Bill she would
go nearly due east from the Froward Points. Cheyne’s hope
was that he should reach this viewpoint before she would
have had time to get out of sight had she been on the
former course, so that her presence or absence would
indicate the route she was pursuing.</p>

<p>But when, having reached the place, he found that no
trace of the <i>Enid</i> was to be seen, he realized that he had
made a mistake. From Inner Froward Point to Brixham
was only about seven miles, to Paignton about ten, and
to Torquay eleven or twelve. The longest of these distances
the launch should do in about twenty-five minutes, and as
in spite of all his haste no less than forty-seven minutes
had elapsed since he stepped into the dinghy, the test was
evidently useless.</p>

<p>But having come so far, he was not going to turn back
without making some further effort. The afternoon was
still young, the day was fine, he had had his lunch and
cycling was pleasant. He would ride along the coast and
make some inquiries.</p>

<p>He dropped down the hill into Brixham, and turning
to the left, pulled up at the little harbor. A glance showed
him that the <i>Enid</i> was not there. He therefore turned his
machine, and starting once more, ran the five miles odd
to Paignton at something well above the legal limit.</p>

<p>Inquiries at the pier produced no result, but as he turned
away he had a stroke of unexpected luck. Meeting a
coastguard, he stopped and questioned him, and was overjoyed
when the man told him that though no launch had come
into Paignton that morning, he had about three-quarters
of an hour earlier seen one crossing the bay from the south
and evidently making for Torquay.</p>

<p>Quivering with eagerness, Cheyne once more started up
his bicycle. He took the three miles to Torquay at a
reckless speed and there received his reward. Lying at moorings
in the inner harbor was the <i>Enid</i>.</p>

<p>Leaving the bicycle in charge of a boy, Cheyne stepped
up to a group of longshoremen and made his inquiries.
Yes, the launch there had just come in, half an hour or
more back. Two men had come off her and had handed
her over to Hugh Leigh, the boatman. Leigh was a tall
stout man with a black beard: in fact, there he was
himself behind that yellow and white boat.</p>

<p>Impetuous though he was, Cheyne’s knowledge of
human nature told him that in dealing with his fellows
the more haste frequently meant the less speed. He
therefore curbed his impatience and took a leisurely tone with
the boatman.</p>

<p>“Good-day to you,” he began. “I see you have the <i>Enid</i>
there. Is she long in?”</p>

<p>“’Bout ’arf an hour, sir,” the man returned.</p>

<p>“I was to have met her,” Cheyne went on, “but I’m
afraid I have missed my friends. You don’t happen to
know which direction they went in?”</p>

<p>“Took a keb, sir: taxi. Went towards the station.”</p>

<p>The station! That was an idea at least worth investigating.
He slipped the man a couple of shillings lest his
good offices should be required in the future, and hurrying
back to his bicycle was soon at the place in question.
Here, though he could find no trace of his quarry, he
learned that a train had left for Newton Abbot at 3:33—five
minutes earlier. It looked very much as if his friends
had traveled by it.</p>

<p>For those who are not clear as to the geography of
South Devon, it may be explained that Newton Abbot lies
on the main line of the Great Western Railway between
Paddington and Cornwall, with Exeter twenty miles to the
northeast and Plymouth some thirty odd to the southwest.
At Newton Abbot the line throws off a spur, which, passing
through Torquay and Paignton, has its terminus at
Kingswear, from which there is a ferry connection to Dartmouth
on the opposite side of the river. From Torquay to Newton
Abbot is only about six miles, and there is a good road
between the two. Cheyne, therefore, hearing that the train
had left only five minutes earlier and knowing that there
would be a delay at the junction waiting for the main line
train, at once saw that he had a good chance of overtaking
it.</p>

<p>He did not stop to ask questions, but leaping once more
on his machine, did the six miles at the highest speed he
dared. At precisely 4:00 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> he pushed the bicycle
into Newton Abbot station, and handing half a crown to a
porter, told him to look after it until his return.</p>

<p>Hasty inquiries informed him that the train with which
that from Torquay connected was a slow local from
Plymouth to Exeter. It had not yet arrived, but was due
directly. It stopped for seven minutes, being scheduled out
at 4:10 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> On chance Cheyne bought a third single
to Exeter, and putting up his collar, pulling down his hat
over his eyes and affecting a stoop, he passed on to the
platform. A few people were waiting, but a glance told
him that neither Price nor Lewisham was among them.</p>

<p>As, however, they might be watching from the shelter
of one of the waiting rooms, he strolled away towards the
Exeter end of the platform. As he did so the train came in
from Plymouth, the engine stopping just opposite where he
was standing. He began to move back, so as to keep a
sharp eye on those getting in. But at once a familiar figure
caught his eye and he stood for a moment motionless.</p>

<p>The coach next the engine was a third, and in the corner
of its fourth compartment sat Lewisham!</p>

<p>Fortunately he was sitting with his back to the engine
and he did not see Cheyne approaching from behind.
Fortunately, also, the opposite corner was occupied by a lady,
as, had Price been there, Cheyne would unquestionably
have been discovered.</p>

<p>Retreating quickly, but with triumph in his heart,
Cheyne got into the end compartment of the coach. It was
already occupied by three other men, two sitting in the
corner seats next the platform, the third with his back to
the engine at the opposite end. Cheyne dropped into the
remaining corner seat—facing the engine and next the
corridor. He did not then realize the important issues that
hung on his having taken up this position, but later he
marveled at the lucky chance which had placed him there.</p>

<p>As the train proceeded he had an opportunity, for the
first time since embarking on this wild chase, of calmly
considering the position, and he at once saw that the fugitives’
moves up to the present had been dictated by their
circumstances and were almost obligatory.</p>

<p>First, he now understood that they <em>must</em> have landed at
Brixham, Paignton, or Torquay, and of these Torquay was
obviously most suitable to their purpose, being larger than
the others and their arrival therefore attracting correspondingly
less attention. But they must have landed at one of
the three places, as they were the only ports which they
could reach before he, Cheyne, would have had time to
give the alarm. Suppose he had lodged information with
the police immediately on getting ashore, it would have
been simply impossible for the others to have entered any
other port without fear of arrest. But at Paignton or
Torquay they were safe. By no possible chance could the
machinery of the law have been set in motion in time to
apprehend them.</p>

<p>He saw also how the men came to be seated in the train
from Plymouth when it reached Newton Abbot, and here
again he was lost in admiration at the way in which the
pair had laid their plans. The first station on the Plymouth
side of Newton Abbot was Totnes, and from Torquay to
Totnes by road was a matter of only some ten miles. They
would just have had time to do the distance, and there
was no doubt that Totnes was the place to which their taxi
had taken them. In the event, therefore, of an immediate
chase, there was every chance of the scent being temporarily
lost at Torquay.</p>

<p>These thoughts had scarcely passed through Cheyne’s
mind when the event happened which caused him to
congratulate himself on the seat he was occupying. At the
extreme end of the coach, immediately in advance of his
compartment, was the lavatory, and at this moment, just as
they were stopping at Teignmouth, a man carrying a small
kitbag passed along the corridor and entered. Approaching
from behind Cheyne, he did not see the latter’s face, but
Cheyne saw him. It was Price!</p>

<p>Cheyne took an engagement book from his pocket and
bent low over it, lest the other should recognize him on
his return. But Price remained in the lavatory until they
reached Dawlish, and here another stroke of luck was in
store for Cheyne. At Dawlish, at which they stopped a few
moments later, his vis-à-vis alighted, and Cheyne
immediately changed his seat. When, therefore, just before the
train started, Price left the lavatory, he again approached
Cheyne from behind and again failed to see his face.</p>

<p>As he passed down the corridor Cheyne stared at him.
While in the lavatory he had effected a wondrous change
in his appearance. Gone now was the small dark mustache
and the glasses, his hat was of a different type and his
overcoat of a different color. Cheyne watched him pause
hesitatingly at the door of the next compartment and finally
enter.</p>

<p>For some moments as the train rattled along towards
Exeter, Cheyne failed to grasp the significance of this last
move. Then he saw that it was, as usual, part of a
well-thought-out scheme. Approaching Teignmouth, Price had
evidently left his compartment—almost certainly the
fourth, where Lewisham sat—as if he were about to alight
at the station. Instead of doing so, he had entered the
lavatory. Disguised, or, more probably, with a previous
disguise removed, he had left it before the train started from
Dawlish, and appearing at the door of the second
compartment, had attempted to convey the idea, almost
certainly with success, that he had just joined the train.</p>

<p>A further thought made Cheyne swing across again to
the seat facing the engine. They were approaching
Starcross. Would Lewisham adopt the same subterfuge at this
station? But he did not, and they reached Exeter without
further adventure.</p>

<p>The train going no further, all passengers had to alight.
Cheyne was in no hurry to move, and by the time he left
the carriage Price and Lewisham were already far down
the platform. He wished that he in his turn could find a
false mustache and glasses, but he realized that if he kept
his face hidden, his clothes were already a satisfactory
disguise. He watched the two men begin to pace the
platform, and soon felt satisfied that they were proceeding
by a later train.</p>

<p>They had reached Exeter at 5:02 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> Two expresses
left the station shortly after, the 5:25 for Liverpool, Manchester
and the north, and the 5:42 for London. Cheyne sat down
on a deserted seat near the end of the platform and bent
his head over his notebook while he watched the others.</p>

<p>The 5:25 for the north arrived and left, and still the
two men continued pacing up and down. “For London,”
thought Cheyne, and slipping off to the booking hall he
bought a first single for Paddington. If the men were
traveling third, he would be better in a different class.</p>

<p>When the London express rolled majestically in, Price
and Lewisham entered a third near the front of the train.
Satisfied that he was still unobserved, Cheyne got into the
first class diner farther back. He had not been very close
to the men, but he noticed that Lewisham had also made
some alteration in his appearance, which explained his not
having changed in the lavatory on the local train.</p>

<p>The express was very fast, stopping only once—at Taunton.
Here Cheyne, having satisfied himself that his quarry
had not alighted, settled himself with an easy mind to
await the arrival at Paddington. He dined luxuriously, and
when at nine precisely they drew up in the terminus, he
felt extremely fit and ready for any adventure that might
offer itself.</p>

<p>From the pages of the many works of detective fiction
which he had at one time or another digested, he knew
exactly what to do. Jumping out as the train came to rest,
he hurried along the platform until he had a view of the
carriage in which the others had traveled. Then, keeping
carefully in the background, he awaited developments.</p>

<p>Soon he saw the men alight, cross the platform and engage
a taxi. This move also he was prepared for. Taking a taxi
in his turn, he bent forward and said to the driver what
the sleuths of his novels had so often said to their drivers
in similar circumstances: “Follow that taxi. Ten bob extra
if you keep it in sight.”</p>

<p>The driver looked at him curiously, but all he said was:
“Right y’are, guv’nor,” and they slipped out at the heels of
the other vehicle into the crowded streets.</p>

<p>Cheyne’s driver was a skillful man and they kept steadily
behind the quarry, not close enough to excite suspicion,
but too near to run any risk of being shaken off. Cheyne
was chuckling excitedly and hugging himself at the success
of his efforts thus far when, with the extraordinary
capriciousness that Fate so often shows, his luck turned.</p>

<p>They had passed down Praed Street and turned up
Edgware Road, and it was just where the latter merges
into Maida Vale that the blow fell. Here the street was up
and the traffic was congested. Both vehicles slackened down,
but whereas the leader got through without a stop,
Cheyne’s was held up to give the road to cross traffic. In
vain Cheyne chafed and fretted; the raised arm of the
law could not be disregarded, and when at last they were
free to go forward, all trace of the other taxi had vanished.</p>

<p>In vain the driver put on a spurt. There were scores of
vehicles ahead and a thousand and one turnings off the
straight road. In a few minutes Cheyne had to recognize
that the game was up and that he had lost his chance.</p>

<p>He stopped and took counsel with his driver, with the
result that he decided to go back to Paddington in the
hope that when the other taxi had completed its run it
would return to the station rank. He had been near enough
to take its number, and his man was able to give him the
other driver’s address, in case the latter went home instead
of to the station.</p>

<p>Having reserved a room at the Station Hotel and written
a brief note to his sister saying that his business had
brought him to London and that he would let her know
when he was returning, he lit his pipe, and turning up the
collar of his coat, fell to pacing up and down the platform
alongside the cab rank. He was relieved to find that
vehicles were still turning up and taking their places at the
end of the line, and he eagerly scanned the number plate
of each arrival. For endless aeons of time he seemed to
wait, and then at last, a few minutes before ten, his
patience was rewarded. Taxi Z1729 suddenly appeared
and drew into position.</p>

<p>In a moment Cheyne was beside its driver.</p>

<p>“Ten bob over the fare if you’ll take me quickly to where
you set down those two men you got off the Cornish
express,” he said in a low eager voice.</p>

<p>This man also looked at him curiously and answered,
“Right y’are, guv’nor,” then having paused to say something
to the driver of the leading car on the rank, they
turned out into Praed Street.</p>

<p>The man drove rapidly along Edgware Road, through
Maida Vale and on into a part of the town unfamiliar to
Cheyne. As they rattled through the endless streets Cheyne
instructed him not to stop at the exact place, but slightly
short of it, as he wished to complete the journey on foot.
It seemed a very long distance, but still the man kept
steadily on. The town was now taking on a suburban
appearance and here and there vacant building lots were
to be seen.</p>

<p>Presently they passed an ornate building which Cheyne
recongized as the tube station at Hendon, and shortly
afterwards the vehicle stopped. Cheyne got out and looked
about him, while the driver explained the lie of the land.</p>

<p>They had turned at right angles off the main thoroughfare
leading from town into a road which bore the imposing
title of “Hopefield Avenue.” This penetrated into what
seemed to be an estate recently handed over to the
jerry-builder, for all around were small detached and
semi-detached houses in various stages of construction. Many
were complete and occupied, but in scores of other cases
the vacant lots still remained, untouched save for their
“To let for building” signboards.</p>

<p>Leaving the taxi in a deserted crossroad, the driver
signified to Cheyne that they should go forward on foot.
A hundred yards farther on they reached another cross-road—the
place was laid out in squares like an American city—and
there the driver pointed to a house in the opposite
angle, intimating that this was their goal.</p>

<p>It was a small detached villa surrounded by a privet
hedge and a few small trees and shrubs, evidently not long
planted. The two adjoining lots, both along Hopefield
Avenue and down the crossroad—Alwyn Road, Cheyne
saw its name was—were vacant. Facing it on both streets
were finished and occupied houses, but in the angle
diagonally opposite was a new building whose walls were only
half up.</p>

<p>Thrilled with eager anticipation and excitement, Cheyne
dismissed the driver with his ten-shilling tip and then
turned to examine his surroundings more carefully, and to
devise a plan of campaign for his attack on the enemy’s
stronghold.</p>

<p>He began by crossing Alwyn Road and walking along
Hopefield Avenue past the house, while he examined it as
well as he could by the light of the street lamps. It was a
two-story building of rather pleasing design, apparently
quite new, and conforming to the type of small suburban
villas springing up by thousands all around London. As
far as he could make out it had the usual rectangular plan,
a red-tiled roof with deep overhanging eaves and a large
porch with above it a balcony, roofed over but open in
front. A narrow walk edged with flower beds led across the
forty or fifty feet of lawn between the road and the hall
door. On the green gate Cheyne could just make out the
words “Laurel Lodge” in white letters. So far as he could
see the house appeared to be deserted, the windows and
fanlight being in darkness. After the two vacant lots was
a half-finished house.</p>

<p>Returning presently, he passed the house again, this time
rounding its corner and walking down Alwyn Road.
Between the first vacant lot and Laurel Lodge ran a
narrow lane, evidently intended to be the approach to the
back premises of the future houses.</p>

<p>Glancing round and seeing that no one was in sight,
Cheyne slipped into this lane, and crouching behind a
shrub, examined the back of Laurel Lodge.</p>

<p>It was very dark in the lane. Presently it would be
lighter, as a quadrant moon was rising, but for the moment
everything outside the radius of the street lamps was
hidden in a black pall. The outline of the house was just
discernible against the sky, though Cheyne could not from
here make out the details of its construction. But, standing
out sharply against its black background, was one brightly
illuminated rectangle—a window on the first floor.</p>

<p>The window was open at the top, and the light colored
blind was pulled down, though even from where he stood
Cheyne could see that it did not entirely reach the bottom
of the opening. Even as he watched a shadow appeared on
the blind. It was a man’s head and shoulders and it
remained steady for a moment, then moved slowly out of
sight.</p>

<p>Stealthily Cheyne edged his way forward. The back
premises of Laurel Lodge were separated from the lane by
a gate, and this Cheyne opened silently, passing within.
Gradually he worked his way round a tiny greenhouse and
between a few flower beds until he reached the wall of
the house. There he listened intently, but no sound came
from above.</p>

<p>“If only I could get up to the window,” he thought,
“I could see in under the blind.”</p>

<p>But there was no roof or tree upon which he might
have climbed, and he stood motionless, undecided what
to do next.</p>

<p>Suddenly an idea occurred to him, and full once more
of eager excitement, he carefully retraced his steps until he
reached the lane. It ran on between rough wire palings,
past the two vacant lots and behind the adjoining
half-finished house. Cheyne followed it until he reached the
half-completed building, and then entering, he began to
search for a short ladder.</p>

<p>Every moment the light of the rising moon was increasing,
and after stumbling about and making noises which
sent him into a cold sweat of apprehension, he succeeded,
partly by sight and partly by feeling, in finding what he
wanted. Then with great care he lifted it into the lane
and bore it back to Laurel Lodge.</p>

<p>With infinite pains he carried it through the gate, round
the greenhouse, and past the flower beds to the house. Then
fixing the bottom on the grass plot which surrounded the
building, he lowered it gently against the wall at the side
of the window.</p>

<p>A moment later he reached the slot of clear glass showing
beneath the blind and peered into the room. There he
saw a sight so unexpected that in spite of his precarious
position a cry of surprise all but escaped him.</p>

<h2>Chapter VI. <br/> The House in Hopefield Avenue</h2>

<p>The room was of medium size and plainly though
comfortably furnished as a man’s study or smoking room. In
one corner was a small roll-top desk, in another a table
bearing books and papers and a tantalus. Two large
leather-covered armchairs stood one at each side of the
grate, in which burned a cheerful fire. In the corner
opposite the window was a press or cupboard built into the
wall, and in front of this all furniture had been cleared
away, leaving a wide unoccupied space on the floor. Beside
the wall near this space was a large camera, already set
up, and on a table beside it lay a flashlight apparatus
and two dark slides, apparently of full plate size.</p>

<p>In the room were four persons, and it was the identity
of the last of these that had so amazed Cheyne. Standing
beside the camera were Price and Lewisham, while no less
a personage than Mr. Hubert Parkes of Edgecombe
Hotel notoriety stood looking on with his back to the fire.
But it was not on these that Cheyne’s eyes were glued.
Reclining in one of the armchairs with her feet on the
fender was Susan, the house and parlormaid at Warren
Lodge!</p>

<p>Cheyne gasped. Here was the explanation of one
mystery at all events. He saw now where the gang’s knowledge
of himself and his surroundings had been obtained. He
remembered that he had discussed his visit to Plymouth
during dinner, a day or two before the event. Susan had
been waiting at table, and Susan had been the channel
through which the information had been passed on. And
the burglary! He could see Susan’s hand in this also. In
all probability she had taken full advantage of her
opportunities to make a thorough search of the house for Price’s
letter, and it was doubtless only when it became necessary
to deal with the safe that her friends had been called in.
Probably also she had been waiting for them, and had
admitted them and shown them over the house before
submitting to be tied up as a blind to mislead the detectives
who would presumably be called in. Cheyne suspected also
that Price’s visit was timed at a propitious moment, when
he himself was available and with a free afternoon to be
filled up. No doubt Susan’s part in the affair had been
vital to its success.</p>

<p>But her participation also showed the extraordinary
importance which the conspirators attached to the letter.
Susan’s makeup for the part she was to play, the forging
of her references, her installation in the Cheyne household
and her undertaking nearly two months of domestic
service in order to gain the document, showed a tenacity of
purpose which could only have been evoked to attain
some urgent end. Evidently the gang believed that Price’s
claim on the barony was good, and evidently the others
intended to share the spoils.</p>

<p>Cheyne watched breathlessly what was going on in the
room, and to his delight he presently found that through
the open upper sash he could also hear a good deal of
what was said.</p>

<p>The camera had been set up to face the cupboard, and
Cheyne now saw that a document of some kind was
fastened with drawing pins to its door. Price put his head
under the cloth and moved the camera back and forwards,
evidently focusing it on the document. Lewisham lifted
and examined the flashlight apparatus, then stood
waiting. Parkes stooped and said something in a low tone to
Susan, at which she laughed sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Do you think two will be enough or should we take
four?” said Price when he had arranged the camera to his
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Two, I should say,” Parkes answered. “Even if we lost
the tracing, two negatives should be an ample record.”</p>

<p>“I should take four,” Lewisham declared. “After all
we’ve done what is the extra trouble of developing a
couple of negatives? One or two might be failures.”</p>

<p>“Sime is right,” Price decided. “I shall take four.”</p>

<p>Sime? Cheyne thought perplexedly that the man who
had run the motor on the <i>Enid</i> had been introduced to
him as Lewisham. Sime, was it? Then it occurred to him
that probably each one of the four had met him under an
assumed name, and he listened even more intently in the
hope of finding this out.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that ass Cheyne put the cops on to us,”
went on Sime to the company generally. “James talked to
him like a father and he seemed to swallow it all down as
sweet as milk. Lordy! But you should have heard old
James spouting. He rattled off his patter like a good ’un.
Fresh absurdities each time and all that. Didn’t you,
James?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t give much trouble,” Price replied. “I
shouldn’t have believed anyone would have given in as
soft as he did. I pitched him a yarn about yours truly being
heir to the barony of Hull that wouldn’t have deceived an
oyster, and he sucked it in like a sponge. But it wasn’t that
that worked. It was keeping him without water that did
the trick. When I offered him another day to think it over
he collapsed like a pricked bubble.”</p>

<p>“So would you if you had been in his shoes,” Susan
declared. “I’d like to see you standing out for anything
against your own comfort.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have seen me get into his shoes,” Price
retorted, fitting a dark slide into the camera. “Now, Sime,
if you’re ready.”</p>

<p>Price pressed the bulb uncovering the lens and at the
same time Sime burned a length of magnesium wire
before the document on the door, while Cheyne writhed
with impotent rage at the discovery that he had been
duped in still another particular.</p>

<p>“We’ve done uncommonly well,” Parkes remarked when
the photograph had been taken, “but we’re not by any
means out of the wood yet. In fact, the real work is only
beginning. We don’t even yet know the size of the
problem we’re up against. We’ve got to find that out and then
we’ve got to make a plan and put it through, and all the
time we’ve got to lie low in case that infernal ass has
reported us to the police.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get these photographs taken and then
we’ve got to get our supper,” retorted Price. “For goodness
sake let’s have one thing at a time, Blessington. If you’d
lend a hand instead of standing there preaching, it would
be more to the point.”</p>

<p>Here was another alias. Parkes’s real name was
Blessington. Cheyne was beginning to wonder what Price and
Susan were really called, when the next remark satisfied
his curiosity.</p>

<p>Parkes—or Blessington—took Price’s remark easily.</p>

<p>“Now that’s where you make the mistake, Mr. James
Dangle,” he said with a twinkle in his eye. “Miss Dangle
and I do the real work in this joint: don’t we, Miss
Dangle? We supply the brains, you and Sime only rise to
the muscles. Eh, Miss Dangle?”</p>

<p>But Miss Dangle was not in a mood for pleasantries.</p>

<p>“We shall want all the brains that you can supply and
more,” she answered irritably, and then turning lazily to
the others demanded if they weren’t ever going to be done
messing with the darned camera.</p>

<p>At last Cheyne thought he had got the four fixed in his
mind. The man on the rug—the man who had drugged
him in the Plymouth hotel—was Blessington. The man
who had introduced himself as Lamson and afterwards
said his name was Price bore neither of these appellations:
his name was Dangle. Susan was “Miss Dangle” and
almost certainly sister to James. Lewisham, the motorman
of the <i>Enid</i>, was Sime.</p>

<p>Dangle, Sime, and Blessington! Why, there was
something sinister in the very names, and as Cheyne peeped
guardedly in beneath the blind, he felt there was
something even more sinister in their owners. Dangle, with his
hard-bitten features and without his veneer of polish,
looked a crafty scoundrel. There was a nasty gleam in his
foxy eyes. He looked a man who would sell his best friend
for a shilling. Perhaps Cheyne’s imagination had by this
time run away with him, but Sime now struck him as a
murderous-looking ruffian, and Blessington’s smug
features seemed but to cloak an evil and cruel nature. He was
smiling, but there was nothing mirthful about his smile.
Rather was it the expression that a wolf might be
supposed to wear when he sees a sheep helpless before his
attack. Cheyne did not know if Susan was dangerous, but
he had always suspected she could be vindictive and
bad-tempered. A nice crew, he thought, and he shivered in
spite of himself as he pictured his fate were some accident
to lead to his discovery.</p>

<p>And what inventive genius they had shown! They had
now told him three yarns, all convincing, well-thought-out
statements, and all entirely false. There was first of all
Blessington’s dissertation of his, Cheyne’s, literary efforts,
told to get him off his guard so that a drug might be
administered to him and his pockets be searched. Then
there was the account of the position indicator for ships,
detailed and plausible, a bait to lure him voluntarily
aboard the <i>Enid</i>. Lastly there was the story of the Hull
succession, including the interesting episode of the
attempted rescue of the uncle St. John Price, undoubtedly
related with the object of reducing Cheyne’s scruples in
handing over the letter. These people were certainly past
masters in the art of decorative lying, and once again he
marveled at the trouble which had been taken in making
each story watertight so as to assure its success. It was for
no small reward that this had been done.</p>

<p>Cheyne was getting stiff with cold on the ladder.
Though keenly interested in what he saw, he wished his
enemies would make some move so that he might advance
or, if necessary, retreat. But they appeared in no special
hurry, proceeding with the photographs in the most
careful and deliberate way.</p>

<p>A desultory conversation was kept up, only part of
which he heard, but nothing further was said which threw
any light on the identity of the conspirators or on the
objects for which they were assembled. The work with the
camera progressed, however, and presently three
photographs had been taken.</p>

<p>“Once more,” he heard Dangle remark, and having
pulled out the shutter, the whilom skipper of the <i>Enid</i>
pressed the bulb and another photograph was taken.</p>

<p>“That’s four altogether,” Dangle went on in satisfied
tones. “I guess we’re well provided for against accidents.
What about that bit of supper, old lady?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t we waiting for you?” Susan demanded as she
slowly pulled herself up out of the chair. “Gosh!” she went
on, lazily stretching herself and yawning, “but it’s good to
be done with Devonshire! I was fed up, I can tell you!
Susan this and Susan that! ‘Susan, we’ll have tea now,’
‘Susan, you might bring a tray and take up the mistress’s
breakfast,’ ‘Susan, you might light the fire in the study;
Mr. Cheyne wants to work.’ Yah! I guess I’ve about done
my share.”</p>

<p>The men exchanged glances, but only Dangle spoke.</p>

<p>“I guess you have, old girl,” he conceded. “But finish
out this job and you’ll live like a lady for the rest of your
life.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be a poor look out for you if I don’t,” she grumbled,
and Sime having opened the door, she passed out, followed
by the others. Cheyne, watching breathlessly, saw a light
spring up in a ground floor window, fortunately not below
him, but at the far end of the house.</p>

<p>His heart beat quickly. Was it possible that his great
chance had come already and that the gang had delivered
themselves into his hands? A little coolness, a little
daring, a little nerve, and he believed he could carry off a <i>coup</i>
that would entirely reverse the situation. The document
on the wall must surely be that which these criminals had
stolen from him. Could he not regain it while they were
downstairs at their supper? He decided with fierce delight
that he would try. It was an adventure after his own
heart.</p>

<p>Carefully he grasped the lower sash and pressed gently
upwards. To his delight it moved. With infinite care he
pushed it higher and higher until at last he was able to
work his way into the room. Evidently he had not been
heard, as the muffled sounds of conversation continued to
rise unbrokenly from the supper room. He tiptoed lightly
across the room and gazed in surprise at the document
fixed to the wall.</p>

<p>It was certainly not the copy of a birth or marriage
certificate nor anything connected with a claim to a
barony! It was a sheet of tracing linen some fifteen inches
high by twelve wide, covered with little circles spaced
irregularly and without any apparent plan, like the keys
of a typewriter gone mad. Some of these circles contained
numbers and others letters, also arranged without
apparent plan. The only thing he could read about the whole
document was a phrase, written in a circle from the
center like the figures on a clock dial: “England expects
every man to do his duty.”</p>

<p>Cheyne stared in amazement, but soon realizing that
his time might be short, he silently removed the drawing
pins, folded the tracing and thrust it into his pocket. Then
turning to the camera, he withdrew the dark slide, opened
first one and then the other of its shutters, closed them
again and replaced it in the camera. A few seconds
sufficed to open and close the shutters of the other slide
lying on the table. With a hurried glance round to make
sure that no other paper was lying about which might also
have formed part of the contents of Price’s envelope, he
tiptoed back to the window and prepared to make his
escape.</p>

<p>But as he laid his hand on the blind he was halted by a
sound from below. Someone had opened what was
evidently the back door of the house and had stepped out on
the ground below the window. Then Sime’s voice came,
grumbling and muffled: “Where the blazes do you keep
the darned stuff? How can I find it in the dark?” There
was a moment’s pause, then in a changed voice a sudden
sharp call of “Here, James! Look here quickly! What’s
this?”</p>

<p>He had seen the ladder! Cheyne realized that his retreat
was cut off!</p>

<p>A sudden tumult arose downstairs. Hasty feet ran
towards the garden and voices spoke low and hurriedly
beneath the window. Cheyne saw that his only hope lay in
instant action. He silently hurried across the room, tore the
door open and ran to the head of the stairs. His hope was
that he might slip down and out of the door while the
others were still at the back of the house.</p>

<p>But he was just too late. As he reached the stairs he
heard steps approaching the hall below. His retreat was
cut off in this direction also.</p>

<p>There remained only one thing to do and he did it
almost without thought. Opening the next door to that of
the sitting room, he stepped noiselessly inside, closing the
door save for a narrow chink through which he could hear
and see what was happening.</p>

<p>Two of the men had raced up to the sitting room, and
peeping out, Cheyne saw that they were Blessington and
Sime. In a moment they were out again and running
down, shouting: “It’s gone, James! The tracing’s gone!”
Sounds indicative of surprise and consternation arose
from below, but Cheyne could no longer hear the words.
Then through the window, which also looked out over the
garden, he heard Dangle’s voice: “Keep guard of the
house, Susan and Blessington. Come with me, Sime,” and
the sound of two pairs of feet rushing away towards the
lane.</p>

<p>Instinctively Cheyne realized that his chance had come.
It was now or never. If he could not escape while two of
the conspirators were away, he would have no chance
when all four were present.</p>

<p>He came out of his hiding-place and peeped through
the well down into the hall. The electric light had been
turned on and the hall was brilliantly illuminated. In it
stood Blessington, glancing alternately up the stairs and
out through a door to the back. In his hand he held an
automatic pistol, and from the look of fury and
desperation on his face Cheyne had no doubt that he would not
hesitate to use it if he saw him.</p>

<p>“They must have only just gone!” Blessington cried
through the door with a lurid oath, and Susan’s voice
answered with another equally vivid string of blasphemy.</p>

<p>Cheyne stood tense, scarcely daring to breathe and on
the <i>qui vive</i> to take advantage of any chance that might
offer. But Blessington wasn’t going to give chances. He
stood there with his pistol raised, and unarmed as Cheyne
was, he recognized the hopelessness of trying to rush him.</p>

<p>He thought there might be a chance of escape from
some of the other rooms, and silently crept about in the
hope of finding a window or skylight from which he might
perhaps obtain access to a downspout. But so far as he
could ascertain in the dark there was nothing of the kind,
and after a few minutes had passed he retraced his steps
and set himself to watch Blessington.</p>

<p>He wondered whether he could make some noise with
the ladder which would attract the two watchers to the
garden and thus enable him to make a bolt for the front
door, but while he was considering this he heard other
voices which revealed the fact that Dangle and Sime had
returned. Then Dangle’s voice sounded in the hall: “’Fraid
they’ve got away, but we’d better search the house again
to make sure. You stick at the stairs, Susan, while we do
the lower rooms.”</p>

<p>Steps sounded below as the men moved from room to
room. Cheyne’s heart was pounding as it had done on
different occasions before his ship had gone into action
during the war, but he was calm and collected and
determined to take the least chance that offered.</p>

<p>Presently he heard the men joining Susan in the hall.
Now was the only chance he was likely to get and at all
costs he must make the most of it. He hurried back to the
sitting room window, and setting his teeth, lifted the blind
and silently crawled out.</p>

<p>So far he had not been seen, and as rapidly as he dared
he climbed down the ladder. Another five seconds and he
would have got clear away, but at that moment the alarm
was given. One of the men, looking out of a window, saw
him in the now fairly clear light of the moon. Hurried
steps sounded and Blessington appeared at the open door.</p>

<p>Fearful of his pistol, Cheyne leaped for his life. He
landed on his feet, staggered, recovered himself and darted
like a hare across the flower beds. With any ordinary luck
he should have got clear away, but Blessington had picked
up a broom as he ran, and this he threw with fatal aim. It
caught Cheyne between the legs and he fell headlong.
Other steps came hurrying up. By the light streaming from
the back door he saw an arm raised. It fell and something
crashed with a sickening thud on his head.</p>

<p>He saw a vivid shower of sparks, there was a roaring
in his ears, great dark waves seemed to rise up and
encompass him, and he remembered no more.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch07">

<h2>Chapter VII. <br/> Miss Joan Merrill</h2>

<p>After what seemed ages of forgetfulness a confused sense
of pain began to make itself felt in Maxwell Cheyne’s
being, growing in force and definition as he gradually
struggled back to consciousness. At first his whole body
ached sickeningly, but as time passed the major suffering
concentrated itself in his head. It throbbed as if it would
burst, and he felt a terrible oppression, as if the weight of
the universe rested upon it. So on the border line of
consciousness he hovered for still further ages of time.</p>

<p>Presently by gradual stages the memory of his recent
adventure returned to him, and he began vaguely to
realize that the murderous attempt which had been made
on him had failed and that he still lived.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this reassuring thought, he hesitatingly
essayed the feat of opening his eyes. For a time he gazed,
confused by the dim shapes about him, but at last he came
more fully to himself and was able to register what he
saw.</p>

<p>It was almost dark, indeed most of the arc over which
his eyes could travel was perfectly so. But here and there
he noticed parallelograms of a less inky blackness, and
after some time the significance of these penetrated his
brain and he knew where he was.</p>

<p>He was lying on his back on the ground in the half-built
house from which he had taken the ladder, and the
parallelograms were the openings in the walls into which
doors and windows would afterwards be fitted. Against
the faint light without, which he took to be that of the
moonlit sky, he could see dimly the open joists of the floor
above him, a piece of the herringbone strutting of which
cut across the space for one of the upstairs windows.</p>

<p>Feeling slightly better he tried his pocket, to find, as he
expected, that the tracing was gone. Presently he attempted
some more extensive movement. But at once an intolerable
pang shot through him, and, sick and faint, he lay still.
With a dawning horror he wondered whether his back
might not be broken, or whether the blow on his head
might not have produced paralysis. He groaned aloud and
sank back once more into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>After a time he became sentient again, sick and giddy,
but more fully conscious. While he could not think
collectedly, the idea became gradually fixed in his mind that
he must somehow get away from his present position,
partly lest his enemies might return to complete their work,
and partly lest, if he stayed, he might die before the
workmen came in the morning. Therefore, setting his teeth, he
made a supreme effort and, in spite of the terrible pain in
his head, succeeded in turning over on to his hands and
knees.</p>

<p>In this new position he remained motionless for some
time, but presently he began to crawl slowly and painfully
out towards the road. At intervals he had to stop to
recover himself, but at length after superhuman efforts he
succeeded in reaching the paling separating the lot from
Hopefield Avenue. There he sank down exhausted and for
some time lay motionless in a state of coma.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became conscious of the sound of light but
rapid footsteps approaching on the footpath at the other
side of the paling, and once more summoning all his
resolution he nerved himself to listen. The steps drew
nearer until he judged their owner was just passing and
then he cried as loudly as he could: “Help!”</p>

<p>The footsteps stopped and Cheyne gasped out: “Help!
I’ve hurt my head: an accident.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence and then a girl’s voice
sounded.</p>

<p>“Where are you?”</p>

<p>“Here,” Cheyne answered, “at the back of the fence.”
He felt dimly that he ought to give some explanation of his
predicament, and went on in weak tones: “I was looking
through the house and fell. Can you help me?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” the girl answered. “I’ll go to the police
station in Cleeve Road—it’s only five minutes—and they
will look after you in no time.”</p>

<p>This was not what Cheyne wanted. He had not yet
decided whether he would call in the police and he was
too much upset at the moment to consider the point. In
the meantime, therefore, it would be better if nothing was
said.</p>

<p>“Please not,” he begged. “Just send a taxi to take me to
a hospital.”</p>

<p>The girl hesitated, then replied: “All right. Let me see
first if I can make you a bit more comfortable.”</p>

<p>The effort of speaking and thinking had so overcome
Cheyne that he sank back once more into a state of coma,
and it was only half consciously that he felt his head being
lifted and some soft thing like a folded coat being placed
beneath. Then the girl’s pleasant voice said: “Now just
stay quiet and I shall have a taxi here in a moment.” A
further period of waiting ensued and he felt himself being
lifted and carried a few steps. A jolting then began which
so hurt his head that he fainted again, and for still further
interminable ages he remembered no more.</p>

<p>When he finally regained his faculties he found himself
in bed, physically more comfortable than he could have
believed possible, but utterly exhausted. He was content
to lie motionless, not troubling as to where he was or how
he came there. Presently he fell asleep and when he woke
he plucked up energy enough to open his eyes.</p>

<p>It was light and he saw that he was in hospital. Several
other beds were in the ward and a nurse was doing
something at the end of the room. Presently she came over,
saw that he was awake, and smiled at him.</p>

<p>“Better?” she said cheerily.</p>

<p>“I think so,” he answered weakly. “Where am I,
nurse?”</p>

<p>“In the Albert Edward Hospital. You’ve had a nasty
knock on your head, but you’re going to be all right. Now
you’re to keep quiet and not talk.”</p>

<p>Cheyne didn’t want to talk and he lay motionless,
luxuriating in the complete cessation of effort. After a
time a doctor came and looked at him, but it was too much
trouble to be interested about the doctor, and in any case
he soon disappeared. Sometimes when he opened his eyes
the nurse was there and sometimes she wasn’t, and other
people seemed to drift about for no very special reason.
Then it was dark in the ward, evidently night again. The
next day the same thing happened, and so for many days.</p>

<p>He had been troubled with the vague thoughts of his
mother and sister, and on one occasion when he was
feeling a little less tired than usual he had called the nurse
and asked her to write to his sister, saying that he had met
with a slight accident and was staying on in town for a
few days. Miss Cheyne telegraphed to know if she could
help, but the nurse, without troubling her patient, had
replied: “Not at present.”</p>

<p>At last there came a time when Cheyne began to feel
more his own man and able, without bringing on an
intolerable headache, to think collectedly about his
situation. And at once two points arose in his mind upon which
he felt an immediate decision must be made.</p>

<p>The first was: What answer should he return to the
inevitable questions he would be asked as to how he met
with his injury? Should he lodge an information against
Messrs. Dangle, Sime and Co., accuse them of attempted
murder and put the machinery of the law in motion
against them? Or should he stick to his tale that an
accident had happened, and keep the affair of Hopefield
Avenue to himself?</p>

<p>After anxious consideration he decided on the latter
alternative. If he were to tell the police now he would
find it hard to explain why he had not done so earlier.
Moreover, with returning strength came back the desire
which he had previously experienced, to meet these men
on their own ground and himself defeat them. He
remembered how exceedingly nearly he had done so on this
occasion. Had it not been for the accident of something
being required from the garden or outhouse he would have
got clear away, and he hoped for better luck next time.</p>

<p>A third consideration also weighed with him. He was
not sure how far he himself had broken the law. Housebreaking
and burglary were serious crimes, and he had an
uncomfortable feeling that others might not consider his
excuse for these actions as valid as he did himself. In fact
he was not sure how he stood legally. Under the
circumstances would his proper course not have been to lodge an
information against Dangle and Sime immediately on
getting ashore from the <i>Enid</i>, and let the police with a
search warrant recover Price’s letter? But he saw at once
that that would have been useless. The men would have
denied the theft, and he could not have proved it. His
letter to his bank manager would have been evidence that
he had handed it over to them of his own free will. No, to
go to the police would not have got him anywhere. In his
own eyes he had been right to act as he had, and his only
course now was to pursue the same policy and keep the
police out of it.</p>

<p>When, therefore, a couple of days later the doctor, who
had been puzzled by the affair, questioned him on it, he
made up a tale. He replied that he had for some time been
looking for a house in the suburbs, that the outline of that
in question had appealed to him, and that he had climbed
in to see the internal accommodation. In the semidarkness
he had fallen, striking his head on a heap of bricks. He
had been unconscious for some time, but had then been
able to crawl to the street, where the lady had been kind
enough to have him taken to the hospital.</p>

<p>This brought him back to the second point which had
been occupying his mind since he had regained the power
of consecutive thought: the lady. What exactly had she
done for him? How had she got him to the hospital and
secured his admission? Had she taken a taxi, and if so, had
she herself paid for it? Cheyne felt that he must see her to
learn these particulars and to thank her for her kindness
and help.</p>

<p>He broached the subject to the nurse, who laughed and
said she had been expecting the question. Miss Merrill
had brought him herself to the hospital and had since
called up a couple of times to inquire for him. The nurse
presumed the young lady had herself paid for the taxi, as
no question about the matter had been raised.</p>

<p>This information seemed to Cheyne to involve
communication with Miss Merrill at the earliest possible
moment. The nurse would not let him write himself, but
at his dictation she sent a line expressing his gratitude for
the lady’s action and begging leave to call on his leaving
the hospital.</p>

<p>In answer to this there was a short note signed “Joan
Merrill,” which stated that the writer was pleased to hear
that Mr. Cheyne was recovering and that she would see
him if he called. The note was headed 17 Horne Terrace,
Burton Street, Chelsea. Cheyne admired the hand and
passed a good deal of his superabundant time speculating
as to the personality of the writer and wondering what a
Chelsea lady could have been doing in the Hendon
suburbs after midnight on the date of his adventure.
When, therefore, a few days later he was discharged from
the hospital, he betook himself to Chelsea with more than
a little eagerness.</p>

<p>Horne Terrace proved to be a block of workers’ flats,
and inquiries at No. 17 produced the information that
Miss Merrill occupied Flat No. 12—the top floor on the
left-hand side. Speculating still further as to the
personality of a lady who would choose such a dwelling, Cheyne
essayed researches into the upper regions. A climb which
left him weak and panting after his sojourn in bed
brought him to the tenth floor, on which one of the doors
bore the number he sought. To recover himself before
knocking he felt constrained to sit down for a few
moments on the stairs, and as he was thus resting the door
of No. 12 opened and a girl came out.</p>

<p>She was of middle height, slender and willowy, though
the lines of her figure were somewhat concealed by the
painter’s blue overall which she wore. She was not
beautiful in the classic sense, yet but few would have failed to
find pleasure in the sight of her pretty, pleasant, kindly
face, with its straightforward expression, and the direct
gaze of her hazel eyes. Her face was rather thin and her
chin rather sharp for perfect symmetry, but her nose tilted
adorably and the arch of her eyebrows was delicacy itself.
Her complexion was pale, but with the pallor of perfect
health. But her great glory was her hair. It covered her
head with a crown of burnished gold, and though in
Cheyne’s opinion it lost much of its beauty from being
shingled, it gave her an aureole like that of a medieval
saint in a stained glass window. Like a saint, indeed, she
seemed to Cheyne; a very human and approachable saint,
it is true, but a saint for all that. Seated on the top step of
the stairs he was transfixed by the unexpected vision, and
remained staring over his shoulder at her while he
endeavored to collect his scattered wits.</p>

<p>The sight of a strange young man seated on the steps
outside her door seemed equally astonishing to the vision,
and she promptly stopped and stood staring at Cheyne.
So they remained for an appreciable time, until Cheyne,
flushed and abashed, stumbled to his feet and plunged into
apologies.</p>

<p>As a result of his somewhat incoherent explanation a
light dawned on her face and she smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re Mr. Cheyne,” she exclaimed. She looked at
him very searchingly, then invited: “But of course! Won’t
you come in?”</p>

<p>He followed her into No. 12. It proved to be a fair-sized
room fitted up partly as a sitting room and partly as a
studio. A dormer window close to the fireplace gave on an
expanse of roofs and chimneys with, in a gap between two
houses, a glimpse of the lead-colored waters of the river.
In the partially covered ceiling was a large skylight which
lit up a model’s throne, and an easel bearing a
half-finished study of a woman’s head. Other canvases, mostly
figures in various stages of completion, were ranged
round the walls, and the usual artist’s paraphernalia of
brushes and palettes and color tubes lay about. Drawn up
to the fire were a couple of easy-chairs, books and
ashtrays lay on an occasional table, while on another table
was a tea equipage. A door beside the fireplace led to what
was presumably the lady’s bedroom.</p>

<p>“Can you find a seat?” she went on, indicating the
larger of the two armchairs. “You have come at a
propitious moment. I was just about to make tea.”</p>

<p>“That sounds delightful,” Cheyne declared. “I came at
the first moment that I thought I decently could. I was
discharged from the hospital this morning and I thought I
couldn’t let a day pass without coming to try at least to
express my thanks for what you did for me.”</p>

<p>Miss Merrill had filled an aluminum kettle from a tap
at a small sink and now placed it on a gas stove.</p>

<p>“We’ll suppose the thanks expressed, all due and right
and proper,” she answered. “But I’ll tell you what you can
do. Light the stove! It makes such a plop I hate to go near
it.”</p>

<p>Cheyne, having duly produced the expected plop,
returned to his armchair and took up again the burden of
his tale.</p>

<p>“But that’s all very well, Miss Merrill; awfully good of
you and all that,” he protested, “but it doesn’t really meet
the case at all. If you hadn’t come along and played the
good Samaritan I should have died. I was—”</p>

<p>“If you don’t stop talking about it I shall begin to wish
you had,” she smiled. “How did the accident happen? I
should be interested to hear that, because I’ve thought
about it and haven’t been able to imagine any way it
could have come about.”</p>

<p>“I want to tell you.” Cheyne looked into her clear eyes
and suddenly said more than he had intended. “In fact, I
should like to tell you the whole thing from the beginning.
It’s rather a queer tale. You mayn’t believe it, but I think
it would interest you. But first—please don’t be angry, but
you must let me ask the question—did you pay for the taxi
or whatever means you took to get me to the hospital?”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, you are persistent. However, I suppose I may
allow you to pay for that. It was five and six, if you must
know, and a shilling to the man because he helped to
carry you and took no end of trouble.” She blushed
slightly as if recognizing the unconscious admission. “A
whole six and six you owe me.”</p>

<p>“Is that all, Miss Merrill? Do tell me if there was
anything else.”</p>

<p>“There was nothing else, Mr. Cheyne. That squares
everything between us.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! That’s the last thing it does! But if I mustn’t
speak of that, I mustn’t. But please tell me this also. I
understood from the nurse that you came with me to
hospital. I am horrified every time I think of your having so
much trouble, and I should like to understand how it all
happened.”</p>

<p>“There’s not much to tell,” Miss Merrill answered. “It
was all very simple and straightforward. There happened
to be a garage in the main street, quite close, and I went
there and got a taxi. It was very dark, and when the
driver and I looked over the fence we could not see you,
but the driver fortunately had a flash lamp for examining
his engine, and with its help we saw that you had fainted.
We found you very awkward to get out.” She smiled and
her face lighted up charmingly. “We had to drag you
round to the side of the building where there was a wire
paling instead of the close sheeted fence in front. I held up
the wires and the cabby dragged you through. Then when
we got you into the cab I had to go along too, because the
cabby said he wouldn’t take what might easily be a dead
body—a corp, he called it—without someone to account
for its presence. He talked of you as if you were a sack of
coal.”</p>

<p>Cheyne was really upset by the recital.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” he cried. “I can’t say how distressed I am
to know what I let you in for. I can’t ever forget it. All
right, I won’t,” he added as she held up her hand. “Go on,
please. I want to hear it all.”</p>

<p>Miss Merrill’s hazel eyes twinkled as she continued:</p>

<p>“By the time we got to the hospital I was sure that
nothing would save me from being hanged for murder. But
there was no trouble. I simply told my story, left my name
and address, and that was all. Now tell me what really
happened to you; or rather wait until we’ve had tea.”</p>

<p>Cheyne sat back in his chair admiring the easy grace
with which she moved about as she prepared the meal. She
was really an awfully nice looking girl, he thought; not
perhaps exactly pretty, but jolly looking, the kind of girl
it is a pleasure just to sit down and watch. And as they
chatted over tea he discovered that she had a mind of her
own. Indeed, she showed a nimble wit and a shrewd if
rather quaint outlook on men and things.</p>

<p>“You mentioned Dartmouth just now,” she remarked
presently. “Do you know it well?”</p>

<p>“Why, I live there.”</p>

<p>“Do you really? Do you know people there called
Beresford?”</p>

<p>“Archie and Flo? Rather. They live on our road, but
about half a mile nearer the town. Do you know them?”</p>

<p>“Flo only. I’ve been going to stay with them two or
three times, though for one reason or another it has
always fallen through. I was at school with Flo—Flo
Salter, she was then.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! Archie is rather a pal of mine. Comes out
yachting sometimes. A good sort.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never met him, but I used to chum with Flo.
Congratulations, Mr. Cheyne.”</p>

<p>Cheyne stared at her and she smiled gaily across.</p>

<p>“You haven’t said that the world is very small after all,”
she explained.</p>

<p>Cheyne laughed.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of it or I should,” he admitted. “But I
hope you will come down to the Beresfords. I’d love to
take you out in my yacht—that is, if you like yachting.”</p>

<p>“That’s a promise,” the girl declared. “If I come I shall
hold you to it.”</p>

<p>When tea was removed and cigarettes were alight she
returned to the subject of his adventure.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Cheyne answered, “I should like to tell you the
whole story if it really wouldn’t bore you. But,” he
hesitated for a second, “you won’t mind my saying that it is
simply desperately private. No hint of it must get out.”</p>

<p>Her face clouded.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she exclaimed, “I don’t want to hear it if it’s a
secret. It doesn’t concern me anyway.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it does—now,” Cheyne protested. “If I don’t
tell you now you will think that I am a criminal with
something to hide, and I think I couldn’t bear that.”</p>

<p>“No,” she contradicted, “you think that you are in my
debt and bound to tell me.”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he retorted, “since contradiction is the
order of the day. If that was it I could easily have put you
off with the yarn I told the doctor. I want to tell you
because I think you’d be interested, and because it really
would be such a relief to discuss the thing with some
rational being.”</p>

<p>She looked at him keenly as she demanded: “Honor
bright?”</p>

<p>“Honor bright,” he repeated, meeting her eyes.</p>

<p>“Then you may,” she decided. “You may also smoke a
pipe if you like.”</p>

<p>“The story opens about six weeks ago with a visit to
Plymouth,” he began, and he told her of his adventure in
the Edgecombe Hotel, of the message about the burglary,
of his ride home and what he found there, and of the
despondent detective and his failure to discover the
criminals. Then he described what took place on the
launch <i>Enid</i>, his search of the coast towns and discovery
of the trail of the men, his following them to London and
to the Hopefield Avenue house, his adventure therein, the
blow on his head, his coming to himself to find the tracing
gone, his crawl to the fence and his relief at the sound of
her footsteps approaching.</p>

<p>She listened with an ever-increasing eagerness, which
rose to positive excitement as he reached the climax of
the story.</p>

<p>“My word!” she cried with shining eyes when he had
finished. “To think of such things happening here in sober
old London in the twentieth century! Why, it’s like
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>! Who would believe such a story if they
read it in a book? <em>What</em> fun! And you have no idea what
the tracing was?”</p>

<p>“No more than you have, Miss Merrill.”</p>

<p>“It was a cipher,” she declared breathlessly. “A cipher
telling where there was buried treasure! Isn’t that all that
is wanted to make it complete?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re laughing at me,” he complained. “Don’t
you really believe my story?”</p>

<p>“Believe it?” she retorted. “Of course I believe it. How
can you suggest such a thing? I think it’s perfectly
splendid! I can’t say how splendid I think it. It <em>was</em> brave
of you to go into that house in the way you did. I can’t
think how you had the nerve. But now what are you going
to do? What is the next step?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’ve thought and thought while I was in
that blessed hospital and I don’t see the next move. What
would you advise?”</p>

<p>“I? Oh, Mr. Cheyne, I couldn’t advise you. I’m thrilled
more than I can say, but I don’t know enough for that.”</p>

<p>“Would you give up and go to the police?”</p>

<p>“Never.” Her eyes flashed. “I’d go on and fight the gang.
You’ll win yet, Mr. Cheyne. Something tells me.”</p>

<p>A wild idea shot into Cheyne’s mind and he sat for a
moment motionless. Then swayed by a sudden impulse,
he turned to the girl and said excitedly:</p>

<p>“Miss Merrill, let’s join forces. You help me.” He
paused, then went on quickly: “Not in the actual thing,
I mean, of course. I couldn’t allow you to get mixed up in
what might turn out to be dangerous. But let me come
and discuss the thing with you. It would be such a help.”</p>

<p>“No!” she said, her eyes shining. “I’ll join in if you
like—I’d love it! But only if I share the fun. I’m either in
altogether or out altogether.”</p>

<p>He stood up and faced her.</p>

<p>“Do you mean it?” he asked seriously.</p>

<p>“Of course I mean it,” she answered as she got up also.</p>

<p>“Then shake hands on it!”</p>

<p>Solemnly they shook hands, and so the firm of Cheyne
and Merrill came into being.</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII. <br/> A Council of War</h2>

<p>Cheyne returned to his hotel that afternoon in a
jubilant frame of mind. He had been depressed from his
illness and his failure at the house in Hopefield Avenue
and had come to believe he was wasting his time on a
wild-goose chase. But now all his former enthusiasm had
returned. Once again he was out to pit his wits against this
mysterious gang of scoundrels, and he was all eagerness to
be once more in the thick of the fray.</p>

<p>Miss Merrill had told him something about herself
before he had left. It appeared that she was the daughter
of a doctor in Gloucester who had died some years
previously. Her mother had died while she was a small
child, and she was now alone in the world save for a sister
who was married and living in Edinburgh. Her father had
left her enough to live on fairly comfortably, but by
cutting down her expenditure on board and lodging to the
minimum she had been able to find the wherewithal
necessary to enable her to take up seriously her hobby of
painting. She was getting on well with that. She had not
yet sold any pictures, but her art masters and the dealers
to whom she had shown her work were encouraging. She
also made a study of architectural details—moldings,
string courses, capitals, etc.—which, having photographed
them with her half-plate camera and flashlight apparatus,
she worked into decorative panels and head and tail
pieces for magazine illustration and poster work. With
these also she was having fair success.</p>

<p>Cheyne was enthused by the idea of this girl starting out
thus boldly to carve, singlehanded, her career in the
world, and he spent as much time that evening thinking
of her pluck and of her chances of success as of the
mysterious affair in which now they were both engaged.</p>

<p>His first visit next day was to a man called Hake, whom
he had met during the war and who was now a clerk in
one of the departments of the Admiralty. From him he
received definite confirmation that the whole of the Hull
barony story was a fabrication of James Dangle’s nimble
brain. No such diplomat as St. John Price had ever
existed, though it was true that Arnold Price had at the
time in question been third officer of the <i>Maurania</i>. Hake
added a further interesting fact, though whether it was
connected with Cheyne’s affair there was nothing to
indicate. Price, the real Arnold Price through whom the whole
mystery had arisen, had recently disappeared. He had left
his ship at Bombay on a few days’ leave and had not
returned. At least he had not returned up to the latest
date of which Hake had heard. Cheyne begged his friend
to let him know immediately if anything was learned as
to Price’s fate, which the other promised to do.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Cheyne once more climbed the ten
flights of stairs in No. 17 Horne Terrace, but this time he
took the ascent slowly enough to avoid having to sit down
to recover at the top. Miss Merrill opened to his knock.
She was painting and a girl sat on the throne, the
original of the picture he had seen the day before. He was
told that he might sit down and smoke so long as he kept
perfectly quiet and did not interrupt, and for half an hour
he lay in the big armchair watching the face on the canvas
grow more and more like that of the model. Then a little
clock struck four silvery chimes, Miss Merrill threw down
her brushes and palette and said “Time!” and the model
relaxed her position. Both girls disappeared into the
bedroom and emerged presently, the model in outdoor garb
and Miss Merrill without her overall. The model let
herself out with a “Good-afternoon, Miss Merrill,” while the
lady of the house took up the aluminum kettle and began
to fill it.</p>

<p>“Gas stove,” she said tersely.</p>

<p>Cheyne produced the expected plop, then stood with
his back to the fire, watching his hostess’s preparations for
tea. The removal of the overall had revealed a light green
knitted jumper of what he believed was artificial silk, with
a skirt of a darker shade of the same color. A simple dress,
he thought, but tremendously effective. How splendidly it
set off the red gold of her hair, and how charmingly it
revealed the graceful lines of her slender figure! With her
comely, pleasant face and her clear, direct eyes she looked
one who would make a good pal.</p>

<p>“Well now, and what’s the program?” she said briskly
when tea had been disposed of.</p>

<p>Cheyne began to fill his pipe.</p>

<p>“I scarcely know,” he said slowly. “I’m afraid I’ve not
any cut and dried scheme to put up except that I already
mentioned: to get into that house somehow and have a
look around.”</p>

<p>She moved nervously.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it,” she declared. “There are many
objections to it.”</p>

<p>“I know there are, but what can you suggest?”</p>

<p>“First of all there’s the actual danger,” she went on,
continuing her own train of thought and ignoring his
question. “These people have tried to murder you once
already, and if they find you in their house again they’ll
not bungle it a second time.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take my chance of that.”</p>

<p>“But have you thought that they have an easier way out
of it than that? All they have to do is to hand you over to
the nearest policeman on a charge of burglary. You would
get two or three years or maybe more.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t dare. Remember what I could tell
about them.”</p>

<p>“Who would believe you? They, the picture of injured
innocence, would deny the whole thing. You would say
they attempted to murder you. They would ridicule the
idea. And—there you are.”</p>

<p>“But I could prove it. There was my injured head, and
you found me at that house.”</p>

<p>“And what did you yourself tell the doctor had
happened to you? No, you wouldn’t have the ghost of a case.”</p>

<p>“But Susan Dangle was at our house for several weeks.
She could be identified.”</p>

<p>“How would that help? She would of course admit being
there, but would deny everything else. And you couldn’t
prove anything. Why, the gang would point out that it was
Susan’s presence at your house that had suggested the
whole story to you.”</p>

<p>Cheyne shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” he declared. “There would be
a good deal of corroborative evidence on my side. And
then there was Blessington at the hotel at Plymouth. He
could be identified by the staff.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” she admitted. “But even that wouldn’t
help you much. He would deny having drugged you and
you couldn’t prove he had. No, the more I think of it the
better their position seems to be.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, what’s the alternative?”</p>

<p>She shook her head and for a moment silence reigned.
Then she went on:</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking about the gang since you told me
the story—it’s another point, of course—but it occurs to
me they must have had a fine old shock on the morning
after your visit.”</p>

<p>Cheyne looked up sharply.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, they must have been worried to death to know
what had happened to you. Your dead body wasn’t
found—they’d soon have heard of it if it had been. And no
information was given to the police about the affair—they’d
soon have heard of that too. And you haven’t struck
at them. Probably they’ve made inquiries at Dartmouth
and found you haven’t gone home. They’ll absolutely be
scared into fits to know whether you’re alive or dead, or
what blow may not be being built up against them.
Though they richly deserve it, I don’t envy them their
position.”</p>

<p>This was a new idea to Cheyne.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” he returned, then he
laughed. “Yes, it didn’t work out quite as they wanted, did
it? But I expect they know all about me. Don’t you think
that under the circumstances they would have gone round
making discreet inquiries at the hospitals?”</p>

<p>“Well, that is at least something to be done. First job:
find out if possible if anyone asked about you at the Albert
Edward. If that fails, same question elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Right: that’s an idea. But it is not enough.” Cheyne
shook his head to give emphasis to his remark. “We must
do something more. And the only thing I can think of is
to get into that house again and see what I can find. I’ll
risk the police.”</p>

<p>Miss Merrill was evidently thrilled, but not converted.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be in too great a hurry,” she counseled.
“How would it do if we went out there first and had a
look around?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that we should gain much by looking at the
outside of the house.”</p>

<p>“You never know. Let’s go as soon as it gets dark
tonight. If we see nothing no harm is done.”</p>

<p>Cheyne was not averse to the idea of an excursion in
the company of his new friend, and he readily agreed,
provided Miss Merrill gave her word not to run into any
danger.</p>

<p>“I think you should put on a hat with a low brim and
wear something with a high collar,” he suggested. “I’ll do
the same, and in the dark we’re not likely to be noticed
even if any of the gang are about.”</p>

<p>Miss Merrill pointed out that as she was unknown to
the gang, it did not matter if her features were seen, but
Cheyne was insistent.</p>

<p>“You don’t know,” he said. “We might both be seen,
and then it would be as bad for you as for me. There’ll
be unavoidable risks enough in this job without taking on
any we needn’t.”</p>

<p>They discussed their plans in detail, then Cheyne
remarked: “Now that’s settled, what’s wrong with your
coming and having a bit of dinner with me as a prelude
to adventure?”</p>

<p>“That sounds bookish. Are you keen on books? I’ll go
and have dinner if I may pay my share, not otherwise.”</p>

<p>Cheyne protested, but she was adamant. It appeared
further she was a great reader, and they discussed books
until it was time to go out. Then after dinner at an Italian
restaurant in Soho they took the tube to Hendon and
began to walk towards Hopefield Avenue.</p>

<p>The night was chilly for mid-May, but calm and dry.
It would soon be quite dark out of the radius of the street
lamps, as the quarter moon had not yet risen and clouds
obscured the light of the stars. In the main street there
was plenty of traffic, but Hopefield Avenue was deserted
and their footsteps rang out loudly on the pavements.</p>

<p>“Let’s walk past it,” Miss Merrill suggested, “and
perhaps we can hide and watch what goes on.”</p>

<p>They did so. Laurel Lodge looked as before except that
the lower front windows were lighted up. Building
operations, however, had been much advanced in the six weeks
since Cheyne’s last visit. The almost completed walls of a
house stood on the next lot, and the house in which the
supposed dead body of Cheyne had been abandoned was
practically complete.</p>

<p>“Half-finished houses are the stunt in this game,”
Cheyne observed. “Suppose we go back to that next door
to our friends and see from there if anything happens.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later they had passed along the lane at the
back of the houses and taken up their positions in what
was evidently to be the hall of the new house. A small
window looked out from its side, not forty feet from the
hall door of Laurel Lodge. Cheyne made a seat of a plank
laid across two little heaps of bricks and they sat down
and waited.</p>

<p>They were so ignorant as to the steps usually taken by a
detective in such a situation that their idea of watching
the house was simply adopted in the Micawberish hope
that somehow something might turn up to help them.
What that something might be they had no idea. But with
the extraordinary luck which so often seems reserved for
those who blindly plunge, they had not waited ten
minutes before they received some really important information.</p>

<p>The unconscious agent was a postman. They saw him
first pass near a lamp farther down the street, and then
watched him gradually approach, calling in one house
after another. Presently he reached the gate of Laurel
Lodge, and opening it, passed inside.</p>

<p>From where they sat, the watchers, being in line with
the front of the house, were not actually in sight of the
hall door. But there was a heap of building material in
front of their hiding place and Cheyne, slipping
hurriedly out, crouched behind the pile in such a position
that he could see what might take place.</p>

<p>In due course the postman reached the door, but instead
of delivering his letters and retreating, he knocked and
stood waiting. The door was opened by a woman, and her
silhouette against the lighted interior showed she was not
Susan Dangle. The woman was short, stout and elderly.</p>

<p>“Evening, ma’am,” Cheyne heard the man say. “A
parcel for you.”</p>

<p>The woman thanked him and closed the door, while the
postman crossed to a house on the opposite side of the
street. As soon as his back was turned Cheyne left his
hiding-place, and was strolling along the road when the
postman again stepped on to the footpath.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, postman,” said Cheyne. “I’m looking
for people called Dangle somewhere about here. Could
you tell me where they live?”</p>

<p>The postman stopped and answered civilly:</p>

<p>“They’ve left here, sir, or at least there were people of
that name here till a few weeks ago. They lived over
there.” He pointed to Laurel Lodge.</p>

<p>Cheyne made a gesture of annoyance.</p>

<p>“Moved; have they? Then I’ve missed them. I suppose
you couldn’t tell me where they’ve gone?”</p>

<p>The postman shook his head.</p>

<p>“Sorry, sir, but I couldn’t. If you was to go to the post
office in Hendon they might know. But I couldn’t say
nothing about it.”</p>

<p>Nor could the postman remember the exact date of the
Dangles’ departure. It was five or six weeks since or
maybe more, but he couldn’t say for sure.</p>

<p>Cheyne returned to Miss Merrill with his news. A sudden
flitting on the Dangles’ part seemed indicated, born
doubtless of panic at the disappearance of the supposed
corpse, and if this was the cause of their move, no
applications at the post office or elsewhere would bear fruit.</p>

<p>“We should have foreseen this,” Cheyne declared
gloomily. “If you think of it, to make themselves scarce
was about the only thing they could do. If I was alive
and conscious they couldn’t tell how soon they might have
a visit from the police.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to find them,” his companion
answered. “I’ll begin by making inquiries at the house. No,”
as Cheyne demurred, “it’s my turn. You stay here and
listen.”</p>

<p>She slipped out on to the road, and passing through the
gate of Laurel Lodge, rang the bell. The same elderly
woman came to the door and Miss Merrill asked if Miss
Dangle was at home.</p>

<p>The woman was communicative if not illuminating.
No one called Dangle lived in the house, though she
understood her predecessors had borne that name. She and her
son had moved in only three weeks before, and they
had only taken the house a fortnight before that. She did
not know anything of the Dangles. Oh, no, she had not
taken the house furnished. She had brought her own
furniture with her. Indeed yes, moving was a horrible business
and so expensive.</p>

<p>“That’s something about the furniture,” Miss Merrill
said, when breathless and triumphant she had rejoined
Cheyne. “If they took their furniture we have only to find
out who moved it for them. Then we can find where it
was taken.”</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket,” Cheyne declared admiringly. “But
how on earth are we going to find the removers? Have
you any ideas?”</p>

<p>Miss Merrill looked at him quizzically.</p>

<p>“Just full of ’em,” she smiled, “and to prove it I’ll make
you a bet. I’ll bet you the price of our next dinner that I
have the information inside half an hour. What time is
it? Half-past nine. Very well: before ten o’clock. But the
information may cost you anything up to a pound. Are
you on?”</p>

<p>“Of course I’m on,” Cheyne returned heartily, though
in reality he was not too pleased by the trend of affairs.
“Do you want the pound now?”</p>

<p>“No, I have it. But whatever the information costs me
you may pay. Now <i>au revoir</i> until ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>She glided away before Cheyne could reply, and for
some minutes he sat alone in the half-built porch
wondering what she was doing and wishing he could smoke. It
was cold sitting still in the current of chilly air which
poured through the gaping brickwork. He felt tired and
despondent, and realized against his will that he had been
severely shaken by his experiences and was by no means as
yet completely recovered. If it was not for this splendid girl
he would have been strongly tempted to throw up the
sponge, and he thought with longing of the deep armchairs
in the smoking room at the hotel, or better still, in
Miss Merrill’s studio.</p>

<p>Presently he saw her. She was crossing the street in front
of Laurel Lodge. She was directly in the light of a lamp
and he could not but admire her graceful carriage and the
dainty way in which she tripped along.</p>

<p>She pushed open the gate of a house directly opposite
and disappeared into the shadow behind its encircling
hedge. In a moment she was out again and had entered
the gate of the next house. There she remained for some
time; indeed the hands on the luminous dial of Cheyne’s
watch showed three minutes to the hour before she
reappeared. She recrossed the road and presently Cheyne
heard her whisper: “That was a near squeak for my
dinner! It’s not after ten, is it?”</p>

<p>“Half a minute before,” breathed Cheyne, continuing
eagerly: “Well, what luck?”</p>

<p>“Watterson &amp; Swayne. Vans came the day after your
adventure.”</p>

<p>Cheyne whistled below his breath.</p>

<p>“My word!” he whispered, “but you’re simply It! How
in all this earthly world did you find that out?”</p>

<p>She chuckled delightedly.</p>

<p>“Easy as winking,” she declared. “Got it fifth shot. I
called at five of the houses overlooking the Laurel gate,
and pretended to be a woman detective after the Dangles.
I was mysterious about the crimes they had committed and
got the servants interested. There were servants at three
of the houses—the others I let alone. I offered the
servants five shillings for the name of the vans which had
come to take the stuff, and the third girl remembered. I
gave her the five shillings and told her I was good for
another five if she could tell me the date of the moving,
and after some time she was able to fix it. She remembered
she had seen the vans on the day of a party at her sister’s,
and she found the date of that from an old letter.”</p>

<p>“Good for you! I say, Miss Merrill, if you’re going to
carry on like this we shall soon have all we want. What’s
the next step now? Inquiries at Watterson &amp; Swayne’s?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said decidedly, “the next step for you is bed.
You’re not really well enough yet for this sort of thing.
We’ve done enough for tonight. We’ll go home.”</p>

<p>Cheyne protested, but as, apart from his health, it was
obvious that inquiries could not at that hour be instituted
at the furniture removers, he had to agree.</p>

<p>“I shall go round and see them tomorrow morning,”
he remarked as they walked back along Hopefield Avenue.
“I suppose you couldn’t manage to come at that time? Or
shall I wait until the afternoon?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Neither,” she answered. “I shall be busy all day and
you must just carry on.”</p>

<p>Cheyne felt a surprisingly keen disappointment.</p>

<p>“But mayn’t I come and report progress in the
afternoon?” he begged.</p>

<p>“Not until after four. I shall be painting up till then.”</p>

<p>He wanted to see her home, but this she would not hear
of, and soon he was occupying one of these deep chairs in
the hotel smoking room whose allure had seemed so strong
to him in the draughty porch of the half-built house. As
he sat he thought over the turn which this evening’s inquiry
had given to the affair in which he was engaged. It was
clear enough now that Miss Merrill’s view had been
correct and that the Dangles were scared stiff by the absence
of information about the finding of his body. As he put
himself in their place, he saw that flight was indeed their
only course. What he marveled at was that they should
have taken time to remove their furniture. From their
point of view it must have been a horrible risk, and it
undoubtedly left, through the carrying contractor, a
certain clue to their whereabouts.</p>

<p>But when Cheyne began his inquiries on the following
morning he rapidly became less impressed with the
certainty of the clue. A direct request at the firm’s office for
Dangle’s address was met by a polite <i>non possumus</i>, and
when during the dinner hour Cheyne succeeded in
bribing a junior clerk to let him have the information, at a
further interview the lad declared he could not find it. It
was not until after five hours’ inquiry among the drivers
of the various vans which entered and left the yard that
he learned anything, and even then he found himself no
further on. The furniture, which had been collected from
an unoccupied house, had been stored and still remained
in Messrs. Watterson &amp; Swayne’s warehouses.</p>

<p>It was a weary and disgruntled Cheyne who at six
o’clock that evening dragged himself up the ten flights to
Miss Merrill’s room. But when he was seated in her big
armchair with his pipe going and had consumed a whisky
and soda which she had poured out for him he began to
feel that all was not necessarily lost and that life had
compensations for failures in the role of amateur detective.</p>

<p>She listened carefully to his tale of woe, finally dropping
a word of sympathy with his disappointment and of praise
for his efforts which left him thinking she was certainly
the good pal he expected her to be.</p>

<p>“But that’s not the worst,” he went on gloomily. “It’s
bad enough that I have failed today, but it’s a great deal
worse that I don’t know how I am going to do any
better. Those Watterson &amp; Swayne people simply <em>won’t</em> give
away any information, and I don’t see how else it’s to be
got.”</p>

<p>“There’s not much to go on certainly,” she admitted.
“That’s where the police have the pull. They could go into
that office and demand the Dangles’ address. You can’t.
What about the others, that Sime and that Blessington?
Could you trace them in any way?”</p>

<p>Cheyne moved lazily in his chair.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how,” he answered slowly. “We have little
enough information about the Dangles, but there is less
still about the others. We have practically nothing to go
on. I wonder what a real detective would do in such a
case. I feel perfectly certain he would find all four in a
few hours.”</p>

<p>“Ha! That gives me an idea.” She sat up and looked
at him eagerly, and then in answer to his question went
on: “What about that detective who was already engaged
on the case, the one the manager of the Plymouth hotel
recommended? Why not get hold of him and see what he
can do? He was a private detective, wasn’t he—not
connected with the police?”</p>

<p>“He was, and I have his name and address. By Jove,
Miss Merrill, it’s an idea! I’ll go round and see him in
the morning. He’s a man I didn’t take to personally, but
what does that matter if he’s good at his job?”</p>

<p>Though Cheyne thus enthusiastically received his
companion’s suggestion, he was not greatly enamored of the
idea. As he said, he had not liked the man personally, and
he would have preferred to have kept the affair in his own
hands. But he felt bankrupt of ideas for carrying on the
inquiry, and if a professional was to be brought in, this
man whom he knew and who was vouched for by the
manager of the Edgecombe should be as good as another.
He decided, however, that he would not employ the fellow
on the case as a whole. His job should be to find the
quartet, and if and when he did that he could be paid his
money and sent about his business. Cheyne felt that at
this stage at all events he was not going to share the secret
of the linen tracing.</p>

<p>But Cheyne, like many another before him, was to
learn the difficulties which beset the path of him who
makes half confidences.</p>

<h2>Chapter IX. <br/> Mr. Speedwell Plays His Hand</h2>

<p>Next morning Cheyne called at the offices of Messrs.
Horton &amp; Lavender’s Private Detective Agency and asked
if their Mr. Speedwell was within. By good fortune Mr.
Speedwell was, and a few seconds later Cheyne was
ushered into the room of the quiet, despondent-looking
man whom he had interviewed at Warren Lodge nearly
two months earlier.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you’re better, sir,” the detective greeted
him. “I was expecting you would look in one of these
days. You had my letter?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Cheyne, considerably surprised, “and I
should like to know why you were expecting me and how
you know I was ill.”</p>

<p>The man smiled deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“If I was really up to my job I suppose I’d tell you that
detectives knew everything, or at least that I did, but I
never make any mystery between friends, leastwise when
there isn’t any. I knew you were ill because I was down
at Warren Lodge a month ago looking for you and Miss
Cheyne told me, and I was expecting you to call because
I wrote asking you to do so. However, if you didn’t get
my letter, why then it seems to me I owe the pleasure of
this visit to something else.”</p>

<p>“You’re quite right,” said Cheyne. “You do. But before
we get on to that, tell me what you called and wrote
about.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do so, sir. I called because I had got some
information for you, and when I didn’t see you I wrote for the
same reason asking you to look in here.”</p>

<p>The man spoke civilly and directly, but yet there was
something about him which rubbed Cheyne up the wrong
way—something furtive in his manner, by which
instinctively the other was repelled. It was therefore with rather
less than his usual good-natured courtesy that Cheyne
returned: “Well, here I am then. What is your information?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, sir. But first let me recall to your mind
what I—acting for my firm—was asked to find out.” He
stressed the words “acting for my firm,” and as he did so
shot a keen questioning glance at Cheyne. The latter did
not reply, and Speedwell, after pausing for a moment,
went on:</p>

<p>“I was employed—or rather my firm was employed”—what
his point was Cheyne could not see, but he was
evidently making one—“my firm was employed by the
manager of the Edgecombe Hotel to investigate a case of
alleged drugging which had taken place in the hotel. That
was all, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That or matters arising therefrom,” Cheyne replied
cautiously.</p>

<p>The detective smiled foxily.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see you have taken my meaning, Mr. Cheyne.
That or matters arising directly therefrom. That, sir, is
quite correct. Now, I have found out something about
that. Not much, I admit, but still something. Though
whether it is as much as you already are cognizant of is
another matter.”</p>

<p>Cheyne felt his temper giving way.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said sharply. “What are you getting at?
I can’t spend the day here. If you’ve anything to say, for
goodness’ sake get along and say it and have done with
this beating about the bush.”</p>

<p>Speedwell made a deprecating gesture.</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir; as you will. But”—he gave a dry smile—“have
you not overlooked the fact that you called in to
consult me?”</p>

<p>“I shall not do it now,” Cheyne said angrily. “Give me
the information that you’re being paid for and that will
complete our business.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, but with the utmost respect that will only begin
it. I’ll give you the information right away, but first I’d
like to come to an understanding about this other business.”</p>

<p>“What under the sun are you talking about? What
other business?”</p>

<p>“The breaking and entering.” Speedwell spoke now in
a decisive, businesslike tone. “The breaking and entering
of a house in Hopefield Avenue—Laurel Lodge, let us call
it—on an evening just six weeks ago—on the fifth of
April to be exact. I should really say the burglary,
because there was also the theft of an important
document. The owners of that document would be glad of
information which would lead to the arrest of the thief.”</p>

<p>This astounding statement, made in the calm matter-of-fact
way in which the man was now speaking, took
Cheyne completely aback. For a moment he hesitated. His
character was direct and straightforward, but for the
space of two seconds he was tempted to prevaricate, to
admit no knowledge of the incidents referred to. Then his
hot temper swept away all considerations of what might
or might not be prudent, and he burst out: “Well, Mr.
Speedwell, what of it? If you are so well informed as you
pretend, you’ll be aware that the parties lost no document
on that night. I don’t know what you’re after, but it looks
uncommonly like an attempt at blackmail.”</p>

<p>Mr. Speedwell seemed pained at the suggestion. He
assured Cheyne that his remarks had been misinterpreted,
and deprecated the fact that such an unpleasant word had
been brought into the discussion. “All the same,” he
concluded meaningly, “I am glad to have your assurance that
the document in question was not stolen from the house.”</p>

<p>Cheyne was not only mystified, but a trifle uneasy. He
saw now that he had been maneuvered into a practical
admission that he had committed burglary, and there was
something in the way the detective had made his last
remark that seemed vaguely sinister.</p>

<p>“Well, what business of yours is it?” he said brusquely.
“What do you hope to get out of it?”</p>

<p>Speedwell nodded as he looked at the other out of his
close-set furtive eyes.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” he answered approvingly, “that’s what I
like. That’s coming to business, that is. I thought perhaps
I could be of service to you, that’s all. Here are these
parties looking for you to make a prosecution for burglary,
and here you are looking for them for a paper they have.
And here am I,” his face was inexpressibly sly, “in a
position to help either party, as you might say. There’s an old
saying, sir, that knowledge is power, and many a time I’ve
thought it’s a true one.”</p>

<p>“And you want to sell your knowledge?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it reasonable, <em>and</em> natural? It’s my business to get
knowledge, and I have to work hard to get it too. You
wouldn’t have me give away the fruits of my work? It’s
all I have to live by.”</p>

<p>“Your knowledge belongs to your firm.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not in this case it doesn’t. All this work was
done in my own time; it was my hobby, so to speak.
Besides, my firm didn’t ask for the information and doesn’t
want it.”</p>

<p>“What do you want for it?”</p>

<p>A momentary gleam appeared in Mr. Speedwell’s eyes,
but he replied quietly and without emotion: “Two
hundred pounds. Two hundred pounds and you shall hear all
I know, and have my best help in whatever you want to
do into the bargain. And in that case I won’t be able to
tell the other parties where you are to be found, so being
as their question was addressed to me and not to my firm.”</p>

<p>“Two hundred pounds!” Cheyne cried. “I’ll see you far
enough first. Confound your impertinence!” His anger
rose and he almost choked. “Don’t you imagine you are
going to blackmail me! But I’ll tell you what I am going
to do. I’m going right in now to the head of your firm to
let him know the way you conduct his business. Two
hundred pounds. I don’t think!”</p>

<p>He flung himself out of the room and called the girl in
the outer office.</p>

<p>“I want to see the principal of the firm,” he shouted.
“It’s important. Either Mr. Horton or Mr. Lavender will
do. As soon as possible, please.”</p>

<p>The girl seemed half startled and half amused. “<em>Who</em>
did you want to see?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Mr. Horton or Mr. Lavender,” Cheyne repeated
firmly, fixing her with a wrathful stare.</p>

<p>“I—I’m afraid I don’t know where they are,” she
stammered, the corners of her mouth twitching. Yes, she <em>was</em>
laughing at him. Confound her impertinence also!</p>

<p>“You don’t know?” he shouted furiously. “When will
they be in?”</p>

<p>The girl looked scared, then her amusement evidently
overcame her apprehension and she giggled.</p>

<p>“Not today, I’m afraid,” she answered. “You see Mr.
Horton has been dead over ten years and Mr. Lavender at
least five.”</p>

<p>Cheyne glared at her as he asked thickly:</p>

<p>“Then who is the present principal?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Speedwell.”</p>

<p>“Damn,” said Cheyne: then as he looked at the smiling
face of the pretty clerk he suddenly felt ashamed of
himself.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I beg your pardon,” he said, and as he saw
how neatly he had got his desserts he laughed ruefully
himself. This confounded temper of his, he thought, was
always putting him into the wrong. He was just
determining for the thousandth time that he would be more
careful not to give way to it in future when Mr.
Speedwell’s melancholy voice fell on his ears.</p>

<p>“Ah, that is better, sir. Won’t you come back and let
us resume our discussion?”</p>

<p>Cheyne re-entered the private room.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I lost my temper,” he said, “but really your
proposition was so very—I may say, amazing, that it upset
me. Of course you were not serious in what you said?”</p>

<p>Mr. Speedwell leaned forward and became the
personification of suave amiability.</p>

<p>“I sell my wares in the best market, Mr. Cheyne,” he
declared. “You couldn’t blame me for that; it’s only
business. But I don’t want to drive a hard bargain with you.
I would rather have an amicable settlement. I’m always
one for peace and goodwill. An amicable settlement, sir;
that’s what I suggest.” He beamed on Cheyne and rubbed
his hands genially together.</p>

<p>“If you have information which would be useful to me
I am prepared to pay its full value. As a matter of fact I
called for that purpose. But you couldn’t have any worth
two hundred pounds or anything like it.”</p>

<p>“No? Well, just what do you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Dangle’s address.”</p>

<p>“I can give you that. Anything else?”</p>

<p>Cheyne hesitated. Should he ask for all the information
he could get about the sinister quartet and their mysterious
activities? He had practically admitted the burglary.
Should he not make the most of his opportunity? In for a
penny, in for a pound.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of a man called Sime?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course, sir. Number Three of the quartet.”</p>

<p>“I should like his address also.”</p>

<p>“I can give it to you. And Blessington’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Blessington’s too.”</p>

<p>Cheyne was amazed by the knowledge of this Speedwell.
He would give a good deal to find out how he had
obtained it.</p>

<p>“What are the businesses of these men?”</p>

<p>“That,” said Mr. Speedwell, “is three questions. First:
What is Dangle’s business? Second: What is Sime’s
business? Third: What is Blessington’s business? Yes, sir, I
can answer these questions also.”</p>

<p>“How did you find all that out?”</p>

<p>Mr. Speedwell smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“There, sir, you have me. I’m afraid I can’t tell you that.
You see, if we professional detectives were to give away
our little methods to you amateur gentlemen we should
soon be out of business. You, sir, will appreciate the
position. It would be parting with our capital, and no business
man can afford to do that. Anything else, Mr. Cheyne?”</p>

<p>“You mentioned a paper?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“That I can answer partially.”</p>

<p>“What is it about?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then there is something you do not know. What is
the enterprise these men are going into in connection with
the paper?”</p>

<p>“That, Mr. Cheyne, I do not know either. You see I
am perfectly open with you. I have been conducting a
sort of desultory inquiry into these men’s affairs, partly
because I was interested, partly because I thought I could
turn my information into money. I have reached the point
indicated in my answers. I can proceed with the
investigation and learn the rest of what you wish to know,
assuming of course that we come to suitable terms. You
can have the information I have already gained now, with
of course the same proviso.”</p>

<p>“What are your terms?”</p>

<p>“Twenty pounds a question. You have asked six questions
to which I can give complete answers and one which
I can answer partially; say six twenties and one
ten—total, one hundred and thirty pounds.”</p>

<p>“But it’s iniquitous, scandalous, extortionate! I shouldn’t
think of paying such a sum.”</p>

<p>“No, sir? That’s a matter for yourself alone. It seems to
me, then, that our business is completed.” The man
paused, then as Cheyne made no move continued
confidentially. “You see, sir, I needn’t tell a gentleman like
yourself that value is relative and not absolute. If I hadn’t
another party willing to pay for my information about you
I couldn’t perhaps afford to refuse what you might be
pleased to offer. But if I don’t get my hundred and thirty
from you I’ll get it from the other party. It’s a matter of
£. s. d. for me.”</p>

<p>“But how do I know you won’t get my hundred and
thirty and then go to the other party for his?”</p>

<p>Mr. Speedwell smiled craftily.</p>

<p>“You don’t know, sir. In these matters one person has
to take the other’s word. You pay your money and you get
the information you ask for. You don’t pay and I keep it.
It’s for you to say what you’ll do.”</p>

<p>Cheyne sat in thought. It was evident this man could
give him valuable information, and he was well aware
that if he had employed him to obtain it it might easily
have cost him more than the sum asked. He did not doubt,
either, that the quartet had asked for information about
himself. When his dead body had not been found it would
have been a likely move. But he was surprised that they
should have asked under their own names. But then again,
they mightn’t have. Speedwell might have found these out.
It was certainly an extraordinary coincidence that himself
and the gang should have consulted the same private
detective, though of course there was nothing inherently
impossible in it.</p>

<p>On the whole he felt disposed to pay the money. He was
comfortably enough off and he would scarcely feel it. The
payment would not commit him to anything or put him
in any way in the power of this detective. Moreover, the
man was evidently skillful at his job and it might be useful
enough to have him on his side. And last, but not least,
after his failure of the day before it would be a pleasure to
go back to Miss Merrill and tell her how well he had
succeeded on this occasion.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said. “I don’t think you can expect me
to believe that these people came and asked you to find
the burglar who had made off with their confidential
paper, so that they might prosecute. That’s rather tall, you
know. Why didn’t they go direct to the police?”</p>

<p>“I’m only telling you what they said. I’m not saying I
believed it was really what they wanted.” Speedwell
paused. “As a matter of fact I don’t mind telling you what
I think,” he went on presently. “I believe they are scared
about you, and they want to find you to finish up the job
they bungled. That’s what I think, but I may be wrong.”</p>

<p>“And if I pay you your hundred and thirty you’ll give
me your pledge not to give them the information?”</p>

<p>Mr. Speedwell looked pained.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I said that, sir. It was two hundred that
was mentioned. But see here. I don’t want to be grasping.
If you make it the even hundred and fifty I’ll answer your
questions and not theirs. Is it a bargain, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cheyne. “I have my check-book here and
I’ll fill you in a check for the money as soon as I get your
replies.”</p>

<p>Mr. Speedwell beamed.</p>

<p>“Excellent, sir. An amicable settlement. That’s what I
like. Well, sir, I can trust you to keep your word. Here
are the answers to your questions.” He took a bulky
notebook from his pocket and continued:</p>

<p>“First question, Dangle’s present address: Earlswood,
Dalton Avenue, Wembley.” He waited while Cheyne
wrote the address, then went on: “Second question,
Sime’s present address: 12 Colton Street, Putney.” Again
a pause and then: “Third question, Blessington’s present
address: Earlswood, Dalton Av—”</p>

<p>“The same as Dangle’s?”</p>

<p>“The same as Dangle’s, or rather, to be strictly accurate,
Dangle’s is the same as Blessington’s. Blessington lives at
this place and has for several years; Dangle joined him
about six weeks ago, to be precise, on the day after the
incident which I have just forgotten.”</p>

<p>Cheyne nodded with a rueful smile.</p>

<p>“Well, then, these men’s occupations?”</p>

<p>Mr. Speedwell was not to be hurried.</p>

<p>“Fourth question,” he proceeded methodically, “Dangle’s
occupation. Dangle, Mr. Cheyne, is just an ordinary
town sharp. He has a bit of money and adds to it in the
usual ways. He’s in with a cardsharping gang and helps
them in their stunts—for a consideration. He frequents a
West End gaming room, and if there is any fat pigeon
around he’ll lend a hand in the plucking. The sister helps
as a decoy. They’re a warm pair and I should think are
watched by the police. They’ll not want their dealings with
you to come into the limelight anyway, so you’ve a pull
over them there.”</p>

<p>“Has Dangle no ostensible profession?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of, unless you call billiard playing a
profession.”</p>

<p>“You might give me the address of the gaming rooms.”</p>

<p>“27 Greenway Lane, Knightsbridge.”</p>

<p>“What about Sime?”</p>

<p>“Sime is another of the same kidney. He does the night
club end and brings likely mugs on to the gaming rooms.
A plausible ruffian, Sime. A man without scruple and bad
to be up against. He has no ostensible business, either.”</p>

<p>“And Blessington?”</p>

<p>“Blessington is, in my opinion, the worst of the three.
He has ten times the brains of the other two put together
and is an out and out scoundrel. He’s well enough off in
a small way and is supposed to have made his money by
systematic blackmail. He’s supplying the cash for this little
do of yours, whatever it may be. He is believed at Wembley
to be something in the city, but I don’t think he has any
job. Lives on the interest of his money, I should think.”</p>

<p>Cheyne noted the replies, marveling how the detective
had come to learn so much. Then he asked his seventh
question.</p>

<p>“Where is the paper?”</p>

<p>“That, sir, I can only answer partially. It is, or was up
till quite lately, in Blessington’s possession. Whether he
carries it about with him or keeps it in his house or in his
bank I don’t know. He may even have lent it to one of the
others, but he is the chief of the enterprise and it appears
to belong to him.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” Cheyne admitted. “Now what were
you going to tell me apart from these questions—the
information you wrote about?”</p>

<p>“Simply, sir, that the man who drugged you in the
Edgecombe Hotel in Plymouth was named Stewart
Blessington, that he lived at Wembley, and that he drugged
you in order to ascertain if you carried on your person a
certain paper of which he was in search.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell me how he did it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Some simple trick of course, but I had no
chance to find it out. I might perhaps suggest that he had
two similar flasks, one innocent and the other drugged,
and that he changed them by sleight of hand while
attracting your attention elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Cheyne shook his head. He had thought of this
explanation before, but it was not satisfactory. He had been
watching the man and he was satisfied he had not played
any such trick. Besides, this would not explain why no
trace of a drug was found in the food. Speedwell,
however, could make no further suggestion.</p>

<p>Cheyne put away his notebook.</p>

<p>“There’s another thing I should like to know,” he said,
“and that is how you have learned all this. I suppose you
won’t tell me?”</p>

<p>Speedwell smiled as he shook his head.</p>

<p>“Some day, sir, when the case is over. You see, if I were
to show you my channels of information you would
naturally use them yourself, and then where should I come
in? A man in my job soon learns where to pick up a bit
of knowledge. It’s partly practice and partly knowing the
ropes.”</p>

<p>“And there’s another thing I wish,” Cheyne went on as
if he had not heard the other, “and that is that you had
gone a bit further in your researches and learned what
that paper was and what game that gang is up to.”</p>

<p>The detective’s manner became more eager.</p>

<p>“That’s what I was coming to myself, Mr. Cheyne. If
you want that information I can get it for you. But it may
cost you a bit of money. It would depend on the time I
should have to spend on it and the risks I should have to
run. If you would like me to take it on for you I could
do so. But of course it’s a matter for yourself altogether.”</p>

<p>Cheyne reflected. This Speedwell had certainly done an
amazing amount of work already on the case, and his
success so far showed that he was a shrewd and capable
man. To engage him to complete the work would probably
be the quickest way of bringing the matter to a head,
and the easiest, so far as he himself was concerned. But
then he would lose all the excitement and the fun. He had
pitted his wits against these men, and to hand the affair
over to Speedwell would be to confess himself beaten.
Moreover, he would have to admit his failure to Miss
Merrill and to forego any more alarms and excursions
in her company. No, he would keep the thing in his own
hands for the present at all events.</p>

<p>He therefore said that he was obliged for the other’s
offer, which later on he might be glad to accept, but that
for the moment he would not make any further move.</p>

<p>“Right, sir. Whatever you say,” Speedwell agreed
amicably. “I might add what indeed you’ll be able to
guess for yourself from what I’ve told you, that this crowd
is a pretty shrewd crowd, and they’ll not, so to speak, be
beating the air in this job of yours. They’re going for
something, and you may take it from me that something
will be worth their going for. At least, if not, I’ll eat my
hat.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree with you,” Cheyne returned, fumbling
in his pocket. “It now remains for me to write my check
and then we shall be square.”</p>

<p>Cheyne counted the hours until four o’clock, and as
soon as he dared he set off for No. 17 Horne Terrace.
Indeed, he timed his visit so well that as he reached the top
of the tenth flight of steps, the door of room No. 12 opened
and the model emerged. She held the door open for him,
and ten minutes later he was seated in the big armchair
drinking the usual cup of fragrant China tea.</p>

<p>Miss Merrill listened with close attention to his story,
but she was not so enthusiastic at his success as he could
have wished. She made no comment until he had finished
and then her remark was, if anything, disparaging.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite like it, you know,” she said slowly. “From
your description of him it certainly looks as if that
detective was playing a game of his own. It doesn’t sound
straight. Do you think you can trust him?”</p>

<p>“Not as far as I can see him, but how can I help
myself? I expect the addresses he gave are all correct, but I’m
not at all satisfied that he won’t go straight to the gang
and tell them he has found me and get their money for
that.”</p>

<p>“And you think you wouldn’t be wiser to back out
yourself and instruct him to carry on for you?”</p>

<p>Cheyne sat up and took his pipe out of his mouth.</p>

<p>“I’m damned if I will,” he declared hotly. “It might be
a lot wiser and all that, but I’m just not going to.”</p>

<p>“You’re quite sure? I couldn’t persuade you?” she went
on demurely, without looking at him.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine you trying, Miss Merrill. But in any
case I’m going on.”</p>

<p>“Good!” she cried, and her eyes lit up as she smiled at
him. “You’re quite mad, but I sometimes like mad people.
Then if, in spite of all I can say, you’re going on, what
about a visit to Wembley tonight?”</p>

<p>“The very ticket!” Cheyne was swept by a wave of
delight and enthusiasm. “It is jolly of you to suggest it.
And you will come out to dinner and I may pay my bet!”</p>

<p>“As it’s a bet—all right. But you must go away now.
I have some things to attend to. I’ll meet you when and
where you say.”</p>

<p>“What about the Trocadero at seven? A leisurely dinner
and then we for Wembley?”</p>

<p>“Right-o,” she laughed and vanished into the other
room, while Cheyne, full of an eager excitement, went off
to telephone orders to the restaurant as to the reservation
of places.</p>

<h2>Chapter X. <br/> The New Firm Gets Busy</h2>

<p>Cheyne and Joan Merrill took a Wembley Park train
from Baker Street shortly before nine that evening, and a
few minutes later alighted at the station whose name was
afterwards to become a household word throughout the
length and breadth of the British Empire. But at that time
the Exhibition was not yet thought of, and the ground,
which was later to hum with scores of thousands of visitors
from all parts of the world, was now a dark and deserted
plain.</p>

<p>When the young people left the station and began to
look around them, they found that they had reached the
actual fringe of the metropolis. Towards London were the
last outlying rows of detached and semidetached houses
of the standard suburban type. In the opposite direction,
towards Harrow, was the darkness of open country. Judging
by the number of lights that were visible, this country
was extraordinarily sparsely inhabited.</p>

<p>Guarded inquiries from the railway officials had evoked
the information that Dalton Road lay some ten minutes’
walk from the station in a northeasterly direction, and
thither the two set off. They passed along with
circumspection, keeping as far as possible from the street lamps
and with their coat collars turned up and the brims of
their hats pulled down over their eyes. But the place was
deserted. During the whole of their walk they met only
one person—a man going evidently to the station, and he
strode past with barely a glance.</p>

<p>Dalton Road proved, save for its street lamps and
footpath, to be little more than a lane. It led somewhat
windingly in an easterly direction off the main road. The
country at this point was more thickly populated and there was
quite a number of houses in view. All were built in the
style of forty years ago, and were nearly all detached,
standing in small grounds or lots. Here and there were
fine old trees which looked as if they must have been in
existence long before the houses, and most of the lots were
well supplied with shrubs and with high and thick
partition hedges.</p>

<p>Nearly all the gates bore names, and as the two young
people walked along, they had no difficulty in identifying
Earlswood. There was a lamp at the other side of the road
which enabled them to read the white letters on their
green ground. Without pausing they glanced around,
noting what they could of their surroundings.</p>

<p>A narrow lane running north and south intersected
Dalton Road at this point, and in each of the four angles
were houses. That in the southwest corner was undergoing
extension, the side next the lane showing scaffolding
and half-built brick walls. The two adjoining corners were
occupied by houses which presented no interesting
features, and in the fourth corner, diagonally opposite that of
the building operations, stood Earlswood. All four houses
were surrounded by unusually large lots containing plenty
of trees. Earlswood was particularly secluded, the hall door
being almost hidden from both road and lane by hedges
and shrubs.</p>

<p>“Lucky it’s got all those trees about it,” Cheyne
whispered as they passed on down Dalton Road. “If we have
to burgle it we can do it without being overlooked by the
neighbors.”</p>

<p>They continued on their way until they found that
Dalton Road debouched on a wide thoroughfare which
inquiries showed was Watling Street, the main road
between London and St. Albans. Then retracing their
steps to Earlswood, they followed the cross lane, first south,
which brought them back to Wembley, and north, which
after about a mile brought them out on the Harrow Road.
Having thus learned the lie of the land so as to know
where to head in case a sudden flight became necessary,
they returned once more to Earlswood to attempt a closer
examination of the house.</p>

<p>They had noticed when passing along the cross lane
beside the house to which the extension was being made
that a gap had been broken in the hedge for the purpose
of getting in the building materials. This was closed only
by a wooden slat. With one consent they made for the
gap, slipped through, and crouching in the shadow of the
shrubs within, set themselves to watch Earlswood.</p>

<p>No light showed in any of the front windows, and as
soon as Miss Merrill was seated on a bundle of brushwood
sheltered from the light but rather chilly wind, Cheyne
crept out to reconnoiter more closely. Making sure that
no one was approaching, he slipped through the hedge,
and then crossing both road and lane diagonally, passed
down the lane at the side of Earlswood.</p>

<p>There was no gap in the Earlswood hedge, but just as
in the case of that other similarly situated house which he
had investigated, a narrow lane ran along at the bottom
of the tiny garden behind. Cheyne turned into this and
stood looking at the back of the house. The whole
proceeding seemed familiar, a repetition of his actions on the
night he traced the gang to Hopefield Avenue.</p>

<p>But the back of this house was in darkness, and pushing
open a gate, he passed from the lane to the garden and
silently approached the building. A path led straight from
gate to door, a side door evidently, as the walled-in yard
was on his left hand. Another path to the right led round
the house to the hall door in the front.</p>

<p>Cheyne walked slowly round, examining doors and
windows. All of these were fastened and he did not see
how without breaking the glass he could force an entrance.
But he found a window at the back, the sash of which was
loose and easy fitting, and decided that in case of need he
would operate on this.</p>

<p>Having learned everything he could, he retraced his
steps to his companion and they held a whispered
consultation. Cheyne was for taking the opportunity of the house
being empty to make an attempt then and there to get in.
But Miss Merrill would not hear of it. Such a venture, she
said, would require very careful thought as well as
apparatus which they had not got. “Besides,” she added, “you’ve
done enough for one night. Remember you’re not
completely well yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, blow my health; I’m perfectly all right,” he
whispered back, but he had to admit her other arguments were
sound and the two, cautiously emerging from their
hiding-place, walked back to Wembley and took the next train
to town.</p>

<p>She was silent during the journey, but as they reached
Baker Street she turned to him and said: “Look here, I
believe I’ve got an idea. Bring a long-burning electric
torch with you tomorrow afternoon and whatever tools
you want to open the window, and perhaps we’ll try our
luck.” She would not explain her plan nor would she allow
him to accompany her to the studio, so with rather a bad
grace he said good night and returned to his hotel.</p>

<p>The next day he spent in making an assortment of
purchases. These were in all a powerful electric torch,
guaranteed to burn brightly for a couple of hours, a short,
slightly bent lever of steel with a chisel point at one end,
a cap, a pair of thin gloves, a glazier’s diamond, some
twenty feet of thin rope and a five-inch piece of bright
steel tubing with a tiny handle at one side. These, when
four o’clock came, he took with him to Horne Terrace and
spread in triumph on Miss Merrill’s table.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” cried the young lady as she stared
wonderingly at the collection. “Whatever are these?
Another expedition to Mount Everest?”</p>

<p>“Torch: takes the place of the old dark lantern,”
Cheyne answered proudly, pointing to the article in
question. “Jemmy for persuading intractable doors, boxes and
drawers; cap that will not drop or blow off; gloves to
keep one’s fingerprints off the furniture; diamond for
making holes in panes of glass; penknife for shooting back
snibs of windows; rope for escaping from upstairs
windows, and this”—he picked up the bit of tube and
levelled it at her—“what price this for bluffing out of a
tight place? If the light’s not too good it’s a pretty fair
imitation. Also”—he pointed to his feet—“rubber-soled
shoes for silence.”</p>

<p>She gave a delightful little ripple of laughter, then
became serious.</p>

<p>“Have you no anklets?” she asked anxiously. “Don’t say
you have forgotten your anklets!”</p>

<p>“Anklets?” he repeated. “What d’you mean? I don’t
follow.”</p>

<p>“To guard against the bites of sharks, of course,” she
declared. “Don’t you remember the White Knight had
them for his horse?”</p>

<p>Cheyne was so serious and eager that he felt somewhat
dashed, but he joined in the laugh, and when they had
had tea they settled down to talk over their arrangements.
Then it seemed that she really had a plan, and when
Cheyne heard it he became immediately enthusiastic.
Like all good plans it was simple, and soon they had the
details cut and dry.</p>

<p>“Let’s try tonight,” Cheyne cried in excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we should. If these people have some
scheme on hand every day’s delay is in their favor and
against you.”</p>

<p>“Against us, Joan, not against me,” he cried, then
realizing what he had said, he looked at her anxiously. “I
may call you Joan, mayn’t I?” he pleaded. “You see,
we’re partners now.”</p>

<p>She didn’t mind, it appeared, what he called her. Any
old name would do. And she didn’t mind calling him
Maxwell either. She hadn’t noticed that Maxwell was so
frightfully long and clumsy, but she supposed Max <em>was</em>
shorter. So that was that. They returned to the Plan.
Though they continued discussing it for nearly an hour
neither was able to improve on it, except that they decided
that the first thing to be done if they got hold of the
tracing was to copy their adversaries and photograph it.</p>

<p>“Drat this daylight saving,” Cheyne grumbled. “If it
wasn’t for that we could start a whole hour earlier. As it
is there is no use going out there before nine.” He paused
and then went on: “Queer thing that these two houses
should be so much alike—this Earlswood and the one in
Hopefield Avenue. Both at cross roads, both with lanes
behind them, and both surrounded by gardens and hedges
and shrubs.”</p>

<p>“Very queer,” Joan admitted, “especially as there
probably aren’t more than a hundred thousand houses of that
type in London. But it’s all to the good. You’ll feel at
home when you get in.”</p>

<p>They sparred pleasantly for some time, then after a
leisurely dinner they tubed to Baker Street and took the
train to Wembley Park. It was darker than on the
previous evening, for the sky was thickly overcast. There
had been some rain during the day, but this had now
ceased, though the wind had turned east and it had
become cold and raw.</p>

<p>Turning into Dalton Road, they reached the cross-lane
at Earlswood, passed through the gap in the hedge and
took up their old position among the shrubs. They had
seen no one and they believed they were unobserved.
From where they crouched they could see that Earlswood
was again in darkness, and presently Cheyne slipped
away to explore.</p>

<p>He was soon back again with the welcome news that
the rear of the house was also unlighted and that the Plan
might be put into operation forthwith. In spite of Joan’s
ridicule he had insisted on bringing his complete outfit,
and he now stood up and patted himself over to make
sure that everything was in place. The cap, the gloves, and
the shoes he was wearing, the rope was coiled round his
waist beneath his coat, and the other articles were stowed
in his various pockets. He turned and signified that he
was ready.</p>

<p>Joan opened the proceedings by passing out through the
gap in the hedge, walking openly across to the Earlswood
hall door, and ringing. This was to make sure that the
house really was untenanted. If any one came she would
simply ask if Mrs. Bryce-Harris was at home and then
apologize for having mistaken the address.</p>

<p>But no one answered, and the demonstration of this was
Cheyne’s cue. When he had waited for five minutes after
Joan’s departure and no sound came from across the road,
he in his turn slipped out through the gap in the hedge,
and after a glance round, crossed Dalton Road, and passing
down by the side of Earlswood, turned into the lane at
the back. On this occasion he could dimly see the gate into
the garden, which was painted white, and he passed
through, leaving it open behind him, and reached the
house.</p>

<p>The point upon which Joan’s plan hinged was that,
owing to the shrubs in front of the building, it was possible
to remain concealed in the shadows beside the porch,
invisible from the road. She proposed, therefore, to stay at
the door while Cheyne was carrying on operations within,
and to ring if any one approached the house, adding a
double knock if there was urgent danger. She would hold
the newcomer with inquiries as to the whereabouts of the
mythical Mrs. Bryce-Harris, thus insuring time for her
companion to beat a retreat. She herself also would have
time in which to vanish before her victims realized what
had happened.</p>

<p>Feeling, therefore, that he would have a margin in
which to withdraw if flight became necessary, Cheyne set
to work to force an entrance. He rapidly examined the
doors and windows, but all were fastened as before.
Choosing the window with the loose sash upon which he had
already decided, he took his knife and tried to open the
catch. The two sashes were “rabbitted” where they met,
but he was able to push the blade up right through the
overhanging wood of the upper sash and lever the catch
round until it snapped clear. Then withdrawing the knife,
he raised the bottom sash. A moment later he was standing
on the scullery floor.</p>

<p>His first care was to unlock and throw open the back
door, so as to provide an emergency exit in case of need.
Then he closed and refastened the scullery window,
darkening with a pencil the wood where the knife had broken
a splinter. As he said to himself, there was no kind of
sense in calling attention to his visit.</p>

<p>He crossed the hall and silently opened the front door
to see that all was right with Joan. Then closing it again,
he began a search of the house.</p>

<p>The building was of old-fashioned design, a narrow hall
running through its center from back to front. Five doors
opened off this hall, leading to the dining room and the
kitchen at one side, a sitting room and a kind of library
or study at the other, and the garden at the back. Upstairs
were four bedrooms—one unoccupied—and a servant’s
room.</p>

<p>Cheyne rapidly passed through the house searching for
likely hiding places for the tracing. Soon he came to the
conclusion that unless some freak place had been chosen,
it would be in one of two places: either a big roll-top desk
in the library or an old-fashioned escritoire in one of the
bedrooms. Both of these were locked. Fortunately there
was no safe.</p>

<p>He decided to try the desk first. A gentle application of
the jemmy burst its lock and he threw up the cover and
sat down to go through the contents.</p>

<p>Evidently it belonged to Blessington, and evidently also
Blessington was a man of tidy and businesslike habits.
There were but few papers on the desk and these from
their date were clearly current and waiting to be dealt
with. In the drawers were bundles of letters, accounts,
receipts, and miscellaneous papers, all neatly tied together
with tape and docketed. In one of the side drawers was a
card index and in another a vertical numeralpha letter
file. Through all of these Cheyne hurriedly looked, but
nowhere was there any sign of the tracing.</p>

<p>A few measurements with a pocket rule showed that
there were no spaces in the desk unaccounted for, and
closing the top, Cheyne hurried upstairs to the escritoire.
It was a fine old piece and it went to his heart to damage
it with the jemmy. But he remembered his treatment
aboard the <i>Enid</i>, and such a paroxysm of anger swept
over him that he plunged in the point of his tool and
ruthlessly splintered open the lid.</p>

<p>The drawers were fastened by separate locks, and each
one Cheyne smashed with a savage satisfaction. Then he
began to examine their contents.</p>

<p>This was principally bundles of old letters, tied up in
the same methodical way as those downstairs. Cheyne did
not read anything, but from the fragments of sentences
which he could not help seeing there seemed ample
corroboration of Speedwell’s statements that Blessington lived
by professional blackmail. He felt a wave of disgust sweep
over him as he went through drawer after drawer of the
obscene collection.</p>

<p>But here also no luck met his efforts, and with a sinking
heart he took out his rule to measure the escritoire. And
then he became suddenly excited as he found that the
thickness of the wood at the back of the drawers, which
normally should have been about half an inch, measured
no less than four inches. Here, surely, there must be a
secret drawer.</p>

<p>He examined the woodwork, but nowhere could he see
the slightest trace of an opening. He pressed and pulled
and pushed, but still without result: no knob would slide,
no panel depress. But of the existence of the space there
was no doubt. There was room for a receptacle six inches
by twelve by three, and, moreover, all six sides of it
sounded hollow when tapped.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but force. With a sharp stroke
he rammed the point of the jemmy into the side. It
penetrated, he levered it down, and with a grinding, cracking
sound the wood split and part of it was prised off. Eagerly
Cheyne put the torch to the opening, and he chuckled
with satisfaction as he saw within the familiar lilac gray
of the tracing.</p>

<p>Once again he inserted the point of the jemmy to prise
off the remainder of the side, but the heavy wood at the
top of the piece prevented his getting a leverage. He
withdrew the tool to find a fresh purchase, but as he did so,
the front door bell rang—several sharp, jerky peals.
Frantically he jammed in the jemmy, intending by sheer force
to smash out the wood, but his position was hampered,
and it cracked, but did not give. As he tried desperately
for a fresh hold an urgent double knock sounded from
below. Sweating and tugging with the jemmy he heard
voices outside the window. And then with a resounding
crack the panel gave, he plunged in his hand, seized the
tracing, thrust it and the jemmy into his pocket and rushed
out of the room.</p>

<p>But as he did so he heard the front door open and
Dangle’s voice from below: “It sounded in the house.
Didn’t you think so?” and Susan’s: “Yes, upstairs, I
thought.”</p>

<p>Cheyne looked desperately round for a weapon. Near
the head of the stairs stood a light cane chair, and this he
seized as he dashed down. As he turned the angle of the
stairs Dangle switched on the light in the hall, and with
a startled oath ran forward to intercept him. With all his
might Cheyne hurled the chair at the other’s head. Dangle
threw up his arms to protect his face, and by the time he
recovered himself Cheyne was in the hall, doubling round
the newel post. Both Dangle and Susan clutched at the
flying figure. But Cheyne, twisting like an eel, tore himself
free and made at top speed for the back door. This he
slammed after him, rushing as fast as he could down the
garden. He slackened only to pull the gate to as he passed
through it, then sped along the lane, and turning at its
end away from Dalton Road, tore off into the night.</p>

<p>These proceedings were not in accordance with the
Plan. The intention had been that on either recovering
the tracing or satisfying himself that it was not in the
house, Cheyne would close the back door, and letting
himself out by the front, would meet Joan, pull the door to
after them, walk round the house and quietly disappear
via the garden and lane. But the possibility of an
unexpected flight had been recognized. It had been decided
that in such a case the first thing would be to get rid of
the tracing, so that in the event of capture, the fruits of
the raid would at least be safe. Therefore, on all the routes
away from Earlswood hiding places had been fixed on,
from which Joan would afterwards recover it. Along the
lane the hiding place was the back of a wall approaching
a culvert, and over this wall Cheyne duly threw the booty
as he rushed along.</p>

<p>By this time Dangle was out on the road and running
for all he was worth. But Cheyne had the advantage of
him. He was lighter and an experienced athlete, and,
except for his illness, was in better training. Moreover,
he was more lightly clad and wore rubber shoes. Dangle,
though Cheyne did not know it, was hampered by an
overcoat and patent leather boots. He could not gain on
the fugitive, and Cheyne heard his footsteps dropping farther
and farther behind, until at last they ceased altogether.</p>

<p>Cheyne slacked to a walk as he wiped the perspiration
from his forehead. So far as he was concerned he had now
only to make his way back to town and meet Joan at her
studio. He considered his position and concluded his best
and safest plan would be to go on to Harrow and take
an express for Marylebone—if he could get one.</p>

<p>He duly reached Harrow, but he found there that he
would have nearly an hour to wait for a non-stop train
for London. He decided, however, that this would be
better than risking a halt at Wembley Park, and he hung
about at the end of the platform until the train came
along. On reaching town he took a taxi to Horne Terrace
and hurried up to No. 12. Joan had not returned!</p>

<p>He waited outside her room for a considerable time,
then coming down, began to pace the street in front of
the house. Every moment he became more and more
anxious. It was now half past twelve o’clock and she should
have been back over an hour ago. What could be keeping
her? Merciful Heavens! If anything could have happened
to her.</p>

<p>He wrote a note on a leaf of his pocketbook saying he
would return in the morning, and going once more up to
her flat, pushed it under the door. Then hailing a belated
taxi, he offered the man a fancy price to drive him to
Wembley Park.</p>

<p>Some half-hour later he climbed over the wall across
which he had thrown the tracing. A careful search showed
that it was no longer there; moreover it revealed the print
of a dainty shoe with a rather high heel, such as he had
noticed Joan wearing earlier in the evening. He returned
to the shrubs at the gap where they had waited, but there
he could find no trace of her at all. Then he walked all
round Earlswood, but it was shrouded in darkness. Finally,
his taximan having refused to wait for him and all traffic
being over for the day, he set out to walk to London, which
he reached between three and four o’clock.</p>

<p>He had some coffee at a stall and then returned to his
hotel, but by seven he was once more at Horne Terrace.
Eagerly he raced up the steps and knocked at No. 12.
There was no answer.</p>

<p>Suddenly a white speck below the door caught his eye,
and stooping, he saw the note he had pushed in on the
previous evening. Joan evidently had not yet returned.</p>

<h2>Chapter XI. <br/> Otto Schulz’s Secret</h2>

<p>Cheyne, faced by the disquieting fact that Joan Merrill
had failed to reach home in spite of her expressed intention
to return there immediately, stood motionless outside her
door, aghast and irresolute. With a growing anxiety he
asked himself what could have occurred to delay her. He
knew her well enough to be satisfied that she would not
change her mind through sudden caprice. Something had
happened to her, and as he considered the possibilities, he
grew more and more uneasy.</p>

<p>The contingency was one which neither of them had
foreseen, and for the moment he was at a loss as to how
to cope with it. First, in his hot-blooded way he thought
of buying a real pistol, returning to Earlswood, and shooting
Blessington and Dangle unless they revealed her whereabouts.
Then reason told him that they really might not
know, that Joan might have met with an accident or for
some reason have gone to friends for the night, and he
thought of putting the matter in Speedwell’s hands. But
he soon saw that Speedwell had not the means or the
organization to deal adequately with the affair and his
thoughts turned to Scotland Yard. He was loath to confess
his own essays in illegality in such an unsympathetic <i>milieu</i>,
but of course no hesitation was possible if Joan’s
safety was at stake.</p>

<p>Still pondering the problem, he turned and slowly
descended the stairs. He would wait, he thought, for an
hour or perhaps two—say until nine. If by nine o’clock
she had neither turned up nor sent a message he would
go to Scotland Yard, no matter what the consequences to
himself might be.</p>

<p>Thinking that he should go back to his hotel in case
she telephoned, he strode off along the pavement. But he
had scarcely left the doorway when he heard his name
called from behind, and swinging round, he gazed in
speechless amazement at the figure confronting him. It was
James Dangle!</p>

<p>For a moment they stared at one another, and then
Cheyne saw red.</p>

<p>“You infernal scoundrel!” he yelled, and sprang at the
other’s throat. Dangle, stepping back, threw up his hands
to parry the onslaught, while he cried earnestly:</p>

<p>“Steady, Mr. Cheyne; for heaven’s sake, steady! I have
a message for you from Miss Merrill.”</p>

<p>Cheyne glared wrathfully, but he pulled himself together
and released his hold.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak her name, you blackguard!” he said
thickly. “What’s your message?”</p>

<p>“She is all right,” Dangle answered quickly, “but the
rest of it will take time to tell. Let us get out of this.”</p>

<p>Some passers-by, hearing the raised voices, had stopped,
and a small crowd, eager for a row, had collected about
the two men. Dangle seized Cheyne’s wrist and hurried
him down the street and round the corner.</p>

<p>“Let’s go to your hotel, Mr. Cheyne, or anywhere else we
can talk,” he begged. “What I have to say will take a
little time.”</p>

<p>Cheyne snatched his wrist away.</p>

<p>“Keep your filthy hands to yourself,” he snarled. “Where
is Miss Merrill?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say she has met with a slight accident,”
Dangle replied, speaking quickly and with placatory
gestures; “not in any way serious, only a twisted ankle. I found
her on the road on my way back from chasing you, leaning
up against the stone wall which runs along the lane at
the back of Blessington’s house. She had hurt herself in
climbing down to get the tracing which you threw over.
I called my sister and we helped her into the house, and
Susan bathed and bound up her ankle and fixed her up
comfortably on the sofa. It is not really a sprain, but it
will be painful for a day or two.”</p>

<p>Cheyne was taken aback not only by his enemy’s
knowledge, but also by being talked to in so friendly a fashion,
and in his relief at the news he felt his anger draining
away.</p>

<p>“You’ve got the tracing again, I suppose?” he said
ruefully.</p>

<p>Dangle smiled.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, we have,” he agreed. “But I have to admit it
was the result of two lucky chances; first, my sister’s and
my return just when we did, and second, Miss Merrill’s
unfortunate false step over the wall. But your scheme was
a good one, and with ordinary luck you would have pulled
it off.”</p>

<p>Cheyne grunted, and Dangle, turning towards him, went
on earnestly: “Look here, Mr. Cheyne, why should we be
on opposite sides in this affair? I have spoken to my
partners, and we are all agreed. You are the kind of man we
want, and we believe we could be of benefit to one
another. In fact, to make a long story short, I am
authorized to lay before you a certain proposition. I believe it
will appeal to you. It is for that purpose I should like to
go somewhere where we could talk. If not to your hotel,
I know a place a few hundred yards down this street
where we could get a private room.”</p>

<p>“I want to go out and see Miss Merrill.”</p>

<p>“Of course you do. But Miss Merrill was asleep when I
left and most probably will sleep for an hour or two yet,
so there is time enough. I beg that you will first hear what
I have to say. Then we can go out together.”</p>

<p>“Well, come to my hotel,” Cheyne said ungraciously,
and the two walked along, Dangle making tentative essays
in conversation, all of which were brought to nought by
the uncompromising brevity of his companion’s responses.</p>

<p>“You’d better come up to my bedroom,” Cheyne growled
when at last they reached their goal. “These dratted
servants are cleaning the public rooms.”</p>

<p>In silence they sought the lift and Cheyne led the way
to his apartment. Bolting the door, he pointed to a chair,
stood himself with his back to the empty fireplace and
remarked impatiently: “Well?”</p>

<p>Dangle laughed lightly.</p>

<p>“I see you’re not going to help me out, Mr. Cheyne,
and I suppose I can scarcely wonder at it. Well, I’ll get
ahead without further delay. But, as I’ve a good deal to
say, I should suggest you sit down, and if you don’t mind,
I’ll smoke. Try one of these Coronas; they were given to
me, so you needn’t mind taking one. No? I wonder would
you mind if I rang and ordered some coffee and rolls?
I’ve not breakfasted yet and I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>With a bad grace Cheyne rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Coffee and rolls for two,” Dangle ordered when an
attendant came to the door. “You will join me, won’t you?
Even if my mission comes to nothing and we remain
enemies, there’s no reason why we should make our
interview more unpleasant than is necessary.”</p>

<p>Cheyne strode up and down the room.</p>

<p>“But I don’t want the confounded interview,” he
exclaimed angrily. “For goodness’ sake get along and say
what you have to say and clear out. I haven’t forgotten
the <i>Enid</i>.”</p>

<p>“No, that was illegal, wasn’t it? Almost as bad as
breaking and entering, burglary and theft. But now, there’s
no kind of sense in squabbling. Sit down and listen and
I’ll tell you a story that will interest you in spite of
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” Cheyne said with sarcasm as he
flung himself into a chair, “but if it’s going to be more
lies about St. John Price and the Hull succession you may
save your breath.”</p>

<p>Dangle smiled whimsically. “It was for your sake, Mr.
Cheyne; perhaps not quite legitimate, but still done with
the best intention. I told him that yarn—I admit, of course,
it was a yarn—simply to make it easy for you to give up
the letter. I knew that nothing would induce you to part
with it if you thought it dishonorable; hence the story.”</p>

<p>Cheyne laughed harshly.</p>

<p>“And what will be the object of the new yarn?”</p>

<p>“This time it won’t be a yarn. I will tell you the truth.”</p>

<p>“And you expect me to believe it?”</p>

<p>Dangle leaned forward and spoke more earnestly.</p>

<p>“You will believe it, not, I’m afraid, because I tell it,
but because it is capable of being checked. A great portion
of it can be substantiated by inquiries at the Admiralty and
elsewhere, and your reason will satisfy you as to the
remainder.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on and get it over anyway.”</p>

<p>Dangle once more smilingly shrugged his shoulders, lit
his cigar and began:</p>

<p>“My tale commences as before with our mutual friend,
Arnold Price, and once again it goes back to the year 1917.
In February of ’17 Arnold Price was, as you know, third
mate of the <i>Maurania</i>, and I was on the same ship in
command of her bow gun—she had guns mounted fore
and aft. I hadn’t known Price before, but we became
friends—not close friends, but as intimate as most men
who are cooped up together for months on the same ship.</p>

<p>“In February ’17, as we were coming into the Bay on
our way from South Africa, we sighted a submarine. I
needn’t worry you with the details of what followed. It’s
enough to say that we tried to escape, and failing, showed
fight. As it chanced, by a stroke of the devil’s own luck we
pumped a shell into her just abaft the conning tower after
she rose and before she could get her gun trained on us.
She heeled over and began to sink by the stern. I confess
that I’d have watched those devils drown, as they had
done many of our poor fellows, but the old man wasn’t that
way inclined and he called for volunteers to get out one of
the boats. Price was the first man to offer, and they got a
boat lowered away and pulled for the submarine. She
disappeared before they could get up to her, and we could see
her crew clinging to wreckage. The men in the boat
pulled all out to get there before they were washed away,
for there was a bit of a sea running, the end of a
southwester that had just blown itself out. Well, some of the crew
held on and they got them into the boat; others couldn’t
stick it and were lost. The captain was there clinging on to
a lifebelt, but just as the boat came up he let go and was
sinking, when Arnold Price jumped overboard and caught
him and supported him until they got a rope round him
and pulled him aboard. I didn’t see that myself, but I
heard about it afterwards. The captain’s name was Otto
Schulz, and when they got him aboard the <i>Maurania</i> and
fixed up in bed they found that he had had a knock on the
head that would probably do for him. But all the same
Price had saved his life, and what was more, had saved it
at the risk of his own. That is the first point in my story.”</p>

<p>Dangle paused and drew at his cigar. As he had foretold,
Cheyne was already interested. The story appealed to him,
for he knew that for once he was not being told a yarn. He
had already heard of the rescue; in fact he had himself
congratulated Price on his brave deed. He remembered a
curious point about it. A day or two later Price had been hit
in an encounter with another U-boat, and he and Schulz
had been sent to the same hospital—somewhere on the
French coast. There Schulz had died, and from there Price
had sent the mysterious tracing which had been the cause
of all these unwonted activities.</p>

<p>“We crossed the Bay without further adventures,”
Dangle resumed, “but as we approached the Channel we
sighted another U-boat. We exchanged a few shots
without doing a great deal of harm on either side, and when a
destroyer came on the scene Brother Fritz submerged and
disappeared. But as luck would have it one of his shells
burst over our fo’c’sle. Both Price and I were there, I at my
gun and he on some job of his own, and both of us got
knocked out. Price had a scalp wound and I a bit of shell
in my thigh; neither very serious, but both stretcher cases.</p>

<p>“We called at Brest that night and next morning they
sent us ashore to hospital. Schulz was sent with us. By
what seems now a strange coincidence, but what was, I
suppose, ordinary and natural enough, we were put into
adjoining beds in the same ward. That is the second point
of my story.”</p>

<p>Again Dangle paused and again Cheyne reflected that
so far he was being told the truth. He wondered with a
growing thrill if he was really going to learn the contents
of Price’s letter to himself and the meaning of the mysterious
tracing, as well as the circumstances under which it was
sent. He nodded to show he had grasped the point and
Dangle went on:</p>

<p>“Price and I soon began to improve, but the blow on
Schulz’s head turned out pretty bad and he grew weaker
and weaker. At last he got to know he was going to peg
out, as you will see from what I overheard.</p>

<p>“I was lying that night in a sort of waking dream, half
asleep and half conscious of my surroundings. The ward
was very still. There were six of us there and I thought all
the others were asleep. The night nurse had just had a look
round and had gone out again. She had left the gas lit,
but turned very low. Suddenly I heard Schulz, who was in
the next bed, calling Price. He called him two or three times
and then Price answered. ‘Look here, Price,’ Schulz said,
‘are those other blighters asleep?’ He talked as good
English as you or me. Price said ‘Yes,’ and then Schulz
went on to talk.</p>

<p>“Now, I don’t know if you’ll believe me, Mr. Cheyne,
but though as a matter of fact, I overheard everything he
said, I didn’t mean to listen. I was so tired and dreamy
that I just didn’t think of telling him I was awake, and
indeed if I had thought of it, I don’t believe I should have
had the energy to move. You know how it is when you’re
not well. Then when I did hear it was too late. I just
couldn’t tell him that I had learned his secret.”</p>

<p>As Dangle spoke there was a knock at the door and a
waiter arrived with coffee. Dangle paid him, and without
further comment poured some out for Cheyne and handed
it across. Cheyne was by this time so interested in the tale
that his resentment was forgotten, and he took the cup
with a word of thanks.</p>

<p>“Go on,” he added. “I’m interested in your story, as you
said I should be.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would,” Dangle answered with his ready
smile. “Well, Schulz began by telling Price that he knew
he wasn’t going to live. Then he went on to say that he
felt it cruelly hard luck, because he had accidentally come
on a secret which would have brought him an immense
fortune. Now he couldn’t use it. He had been going to let it die
with him, but he remembered what he owed to Price and
had decided to hand over the information to him. ‘But,’
he said, ‘there is one condition. You must first swear to me
on your sacred honor that if you make anything out of it
you will, after the war, try to find my wife and hand her
one-eighth of what you get. I say one-eighth, because if you
get any profits at all they will be so enormous that
one-eighth will be riches to Magda.’</p>

<p>“I could see that Price thought he was delirious, but to
quiet him he swore the oath and then Schulz told of his
discovery. He said that before he had been given charge of
the U-boat he had served for over six months in the
Submarine Research Department, and that there, while
carrying out certain experiments, he had had a lucky accident.
Some substances which he had fused in an electric furnace
had suddenly partially vaporized and, as it were, boiled
over. The white-hot mass poured over the copper terminals
of his furnace, with the result that the extremely high
voltage current short-circuited with a corona of brilliant
sparks. He described the affair in greater detail than this,
but I am not an electrician and I didn’t follow the
technicalities. But they don’t matter, it was the result that was
important. When the current was cut off and the mass
cooled he started in to clean up. He chipped the stuff off
the terminals, and he found that the copper had fused and
run. And then he made his great discovery: the copper had
hardened. He tested it and found it was, roughly speaking,
as hard as high carbon steel and with an even greater
tensile strength! Unintentionally he had made a new and
unknown alloy. Schulz knew that the ancients were able to
harden copper and he supposed that he had found the lost
art.</p>

<p>“At once he saw the extraordinary value of this
discovery. If you could use copper instead of steel you would
revolutionize the construction of electrical machinery;
copper conduits could be lighter and be self-supporting—in
scores of ways the new metal would be worth nearly its
weight in gold. He could not work at the thing by
himself, so he told his immediate superior, who happened also
to be a close personal friend. The two tried some more
experiments, and to make a long story short, they
discovered that if certain percentages of certain minerals were
added to the copper during smelting, it became hard. The
minerals were cheap and plentiful, so that practically the
new metal could be produced at the old price. This meant,
for example, that they could make parts of machines of the
new alloy, which would weigh—and therefore cost—only
about one-quarter of those of ordinary copper. If they sold
these at half or even three-quarters of the old price they
would make an extremely handsome profit. But their idea
was not to do this, but to sell their discovery to Krupps or
some other great firm who, they believed, would pay a
million sterling or more for it.</p>

<p>“But they knew that they could not do anything with it
until after the war unless they were prepared to hand it
over to the military authorities for whatever these chose to
pay, which would probably be nothing. While they were
still considering their course of action both were ordered
back to sea. Schulz’s friend was killed almost immediately,
Schulz being then the only living possessor of the secret.
Panic-stricken lest he too should be killed, he prepared a
cipher giving the whole process, and this he sealed in a
watertight cover and wore it continuously beneath his
clothes. He now proposed to give it to Price, partly in
return for what Price had done, and partly in the hope of
his wife eventually benefiting. I saw him hand over a small
package, and then I got the disappointment of my life, and
so, I’m sure, did Price. Schulz was obviously growing
weaker and he now spoke with great difficulty. But he
made a final effort to go on; ‘The key to the cipher—’ he
began and just then the sister came back into the room.
Schulz stopped, but before she left he got a weak turn and
fell back unconscious. He never spoke again and next day
he was dead.”</p>

<p>In his absorption Dangle had let his cigar go out, and now
he paused to relight it. Cheyne sat, devouring the story
with eager interest. He did not for a moment doubt it. It
covered too accurately the facts which he already knew. He
was keenly curious to hear its end: whether Dangle,
having obtained the cipher, had read it, and what was the
nature of the proposal the man was about to make.</p>

<p>“Next day I approached Price on the matter. I said I had
involuntarily overheard what Schulz had told him, and as
the affair was so huge, asked him to take me into it with
him. As a matter of fact I thought then, and think now,
that the job was too big for one person to handle.
However, Price cut up rough about it: wouldn’t have me as a
partner on any terms and accused me of eavesdropping. I
told him to go to hell and we parted on bad terms. I found
out—I may as well admit by looking through the letters in
his cabin while he was on duty—that he had sent the
packet to you, and when I had made inquiries about you I
was able to guess his motive. You, humanly speaking, were
a safe life; you were invalided out of the service. He would
send the secret to you to keep for him till after the war or
to use as you thought best if he were knocked out.</p>

<p>“You will understand, Mr. Cheyne, that though keenly
interested in the whole affair, while I was in the service I
couldn’t make any move in it. But directly I was demobbed
I began to make inquiries. I found you were living at
Dartmouth, and it was evident from your way of life that
you hadn’t exploited the secret. Then I found out about
Price, learned that he was on one of the Bombay-Basrah
troopships and that though he had applied to be demobbed
there were official delays. The next thing I heard about him
was that he had disappeared. You knew that?” Dangle
seemed to have been expecting the other to show surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew it. I learned it at the same time that I
learned St. John Price was a myth.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s quite true. He left his ship at Bombay on a
few days’ leave to pay a visit up country and was never
heard of again. Presumably he is dead. And now, Mr.
Cheyne,” Dangle shifted uneasily in his seat and glanced
deprecatingly at the other, “now I come to a part of my
story which I should be glad to omit. But I must tell you
everything so that you may be in a position to decide on
the proposal I’m going to make. At the time I was
financially in very low water. My job had not been kept
for me and I couldn’t get another. I was pretty badly hit,
and worse still, I had taken to gambling in the desperate
hope of getting some ready money. One night I had been
treated on an empty stomach, and being upset from the
drink, I plunged more than all my remaining capital. I
lost, and then I was down and out, owing fairly large sums
to two men—Blessington and Sime. In despair I told them
of Schulz’s discovery. They leaped at it and said that if
my sister Susan and myself would join in an attempt to
get hold of the secret they would not only cancel the debts,
but would offer us a square deal and share and share alike.
Well, I shouldn’t have agreed, of course, but—well, I did.
It was naturally the pressure they brought to bear that
made me do it, but it was also partly due to my resentment
at the way Price had turned me down. We thought that
as far as you were concerned, you were probably expecting
nothing and would therefore suffer no disappointment,
and we agreed unanimously to send both Frau Schulz and
Mrs. Price equal shares with ourselves. I don’t pretend any
of us were right, Mr. Cheyne, but that’s what happened.”</p>

<p>“I can understand it very well,” said Cheyne. He was
always generous to a fault and this frank avowal had
mollified his wrath. “But you haven’t told me if you read
the cipher.”</p>

<p>“I’m coming to that,” Dangle returned. “We laid our
plans for getting hold of the package and with some forged
references Susan got a job as servant in your house. She
told us that so far as she could see the package would
either be about your person or in your safe, and as she
couldn’t ascertain the point we laid our plans to find out.
As you know, they drew blank, and then we devised the
plant on the <i>Enid</i>. That worked, but you nearly turned the
tables on us in Hopefield Avenue. How you traced us I
can’t imagine, and I hope later on you’ll tell me. That
night we didn’t know whether we had killed you or not.
We didn’t want to and hadn’t meant to, but we might
easily have done so. When your body was not found in the
morning we became panicky and cleared out. Then there
came your attempt of last night. But for an accident it
would have succeeded. Now we have come to the
conclusion that you are too clever and determined to have
you for an enemy. We are accordingly faced with an
alternative. Either we must murder you and Miss Merrill
or we must get you on to our side. The first we all shrink
from, though”—and here Dangle’s eye showed a nasty
gleam—“if it was that or our failure we shouldn’t hesitate,
but the second is what we should all prefer. In short, Mr.
Cheyne, will you and Miss Merrill join us in trading
Schulz’s secret: all, including Frau Schulz and Mrs. Price,
to share equally? We think that’s a fair offer and we
extremely hope you won’t turn us down.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me if you’ve read the cipher.”</p>

<p>“I forgot that. I’m sorry to say that we have not, and
that’s another reason we want you and Miss Merrill. We
want two fresh brains on it. But the covering letter shows
that the secret is in the cipher and it must be possible to
read it.”</p>

<p>Cheyne did not reply as he sat considering this unexpected
move. If he were satisfied as to Arnold Price’s death and
if the quartet had been trustworthy he would not have
hesitated. Frau Schulz would get her eighth and Mrs.
Price would get a quite unexpected windfall. Moreover,
the people who worked the invention were entitled to
some return for their trouble. No, the proposal was
reasonable; in fact it was too reasonable. It was more
reasonable than he would have expected from people who had
already acted as these four had done. He found it
impossible to trust in their <i>bona fides</i>. He would like to have Joan
Merrill’s views before replying. He therefore temporized.</p>

<p>“Your proposal is certainly attractive,” he said, “but
before coming to a conclusion Miss Merrill must be
consulted. She would be a party to it, same as myself. Suppose
we go out and see her now, and then I will give you my
answer.”</p>

<p>Dangle’s face took on a graver expression.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you can’t do that,” he answered slowly.
“You see, there is more in it than I have told you, though
I hoped to avoid this side of it. Please put yourself in our
place. I come to you with this offer. I don’t know whether
you will accept it or turn it down. If you turn it down
there is nothing to prevent you, with the information I
have just given you, going to the police and claiming the
whole secret and prosecuting us. Whether you would be
likely to win your case wouldn’t matter. You might, and
that would be too big a risk for us. We have therefore in
self-defense had to take precautions. And the precautions
we have taken are these. Earlswood has been evacuated.
Just as we left Hopefield Avenue so we have left Dalton
Road. Our party—and Miss Merrill”—he slightly stressed
the “and” and in his voice Cheyne sensed a veiled
threat—“have taken up their quarters at another house some
distance from town. In self-defense we must have your
acceptance <em>before</em> further negotiations take place. You must see
this for yourself.”</p>

<p>“And if I refuse?”</p>

<p>Dangle lowered his voice and spoke very earnestly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cheyne, if you refuse you will never see Miss
Merrill alive!”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch12">

<h2>Chapter XII. <br/> In the Enemy’s Lair</h2>

<p>With some difficulty Cheyne overcame a sudden urge to
leap at his companion’s throat.</p>

<p>“You infernal scoundrel!” he cried thickly. “Injure a
hair of Miss Merrill’s head and you and your confounded
friends will hang! I’ll go to Scotland Yard. Do you think
I mind about myself?”</p>

<p>Dangle gave a cheery smile.</p>

<p>“Right, Mr. Cheyne,” he answered Lid “by all
means. Just do go to Scotland Yard and make your
complaint. And what are you going to tell them? That Miss
Merrill is in the hands of a dangerous gang of ruffians,
and must be rescued immediately? And the present
address of this gang is—?” He looked quizzically at the
other. “I don’t think so. I’m afraid Scotland Yard would
be too slow for you. You see, my friends are waiting for a
telephone message from me. If that is not received or if it is
unsatisfactory—well, don’t let us discuss unpleasant topics,
but Miss Merrill will be very, very sorry.”</p>

<p>Cheyne choked with rage, but for the moment he found
himself unable to reply. That he was being bluffed he had
no doubt, and in any other circumstances he would have
taken a stronger line. But where Joan Merrill was
concerned he could run no risks. It was evident that she really
was in the power of the gang. Dangle could not possibly
have known about the throwing of the tracing over the
wall unless he really had found her as he had described.</p>

<p>A very short cogitation convinced Cheyne that these
people had him in their toils. Application to Scotland
Yard would be useless. No doubt the police could find the
conspirators, but they could not find them in time. So far
as retaliation or a constructive policy was concerned, he
saw that he was down and out.</p>

<p>His thoughts turned to the proposal Dangle had made
him. It was certainly fair—too fair, he still thought—but if
it was a genuine offer, he need have no qualms about
accepting it. Frau Schulz, Mrs. Price, Joan and himself
were all promised shares of the profits. A clause could be
put in covering Price, if he afterwards turned out to be
alive. The gang might be a crowd of sharpers and thieves—so
at least the melancholy Speedwell had said—but, as
Cheyne came to look at it, they had not really broken the
law to a much greater extent than he had himself. His case
to the authorities—suppose he were to lay it before
them—would not be so overwhelmingly clear. Something could
be said for—or rather against—both sides.</p>

<p>If he had to give way he might as well give way with a
good grace. He therefore choked down his rage, and
turning to Dangle, said quietly:</p>

<p>“I see you’ve won this trick. I’ll accept your offer and go
with you.”</p>

<p>Dangle, evidently delighted, sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Splendid, Mr. Cheyne,” he cried warmly, holding out
his hand. “Shake hands, won’t you? You’ll not repent your
action, I promise you.”</p>

<p>But this was too much for Cheyne.</p>

<p>“No,” he declared. “Not yet. You haven’t satisfied me
of your <i>bona fides</i>. I’m sorry, but you have only yourselves
to thank. When I find Miss Merrill at liberty and see
Schulz’s cipher, I’ll be satisfied, and then I will join with
you and give you all the help I can.”</p>

<p>Dangle seemed rather dashed, but he laughed shortly
as he answered: “I suppose we deserve that after all. But
you will soon be convinced. There is just a formality to be
gone through before we start. Though you may not believe
my word, we believe yours, and we have agreed that all
that we want before taking you further into our
confidence, is that you swear an oath of loyalty to us. You won’t
object to that, I presume?”</p>

<p>Cheyne hesitated, then he said:</p>

<p>“I swear on my sacred honor that I will loyally abide
by the spirit of the agreement which you have outlined in
so far as you and your friends act loyally to me and to
Miss Merrill, and to that extent only.”</p>

<p>“That’s reasonable, and good enough,” Dangle
commented. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll go and phone to the
others. You will understand,” he explained on his return,
“that my friends are some distance away from Wembley,
and it will therefore take them a little time to get in. If
they start now they will be there as soon as we are.”</p>

<p>It was getting towards ten o’clock when Cheyne and
Dangle turned into the gateway of Earlswood. A yellow car
stood at the footpath, at sight of which Dangle exclaimed:
“See, they’ve arrived.” His ring brought Blessington to the
door, and the latter greeted Cheyne apologetically, but
with the same charm of manner that he had displayed in
the Edgecombe Hotel at Plymouth.</p>

<p>“I do hope, Mr. Cheyne,” he declared, “that even after
all that has passed, we may yet be friends. We admire the
way you have fought your corner, and we feel that what we
both up to the present have failed to do may well be
accomplished if we unite our forces. Come in and see if
you can make friends with Sime.”</p>

<p>“I came to see Miss Merrill,” Cheyne answered shortly.
“If Miss Merrill is not produced and allowed to go
without restraint our agreement is <i>non est</i>.”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” Blessington returned smoothly. “We
understand that that is a <i>sine qua non</i>. And so Miss Merrill will
be produced. She is not here; she is at our house in the
country in charge of Miss Dangle, and that for two
reasons. The first is this. She met with, as doubtless you know,
a trifling accident last night, and her ankle being a little
painful, she was kept awake for some time. This morning
when we left she was still asleep. We did not therefore
disturb her. That you will appreciate, Mr. Cheyne, and the
other reason you will appreciate equally. We had to
satisfy ourselves by a personal interview that you really meant
to give us a square deal.” He raised his hand as Cheyne
would have spoken. “There’s nothing in that to which you
need take exception. It is an ordinary business
precaution—nothing more or less.”</p>

<p>“And when will Miss Merrill be set at liberty?”</p>

<p>“While I don’t admit the justice of the phrase, I may
say that as soon as we have all mutually pledged ourselves
to play the game I will take the car back to the other
house, and when Miss Merrill has taken the same oath
will drive her to her studio. Perhaps you would write her
a note that you have sworn it, as she mightn’t believe me.
There are a few preliminaries to be arranged with Dangle
and Sime can fix up with you. If you are at the studio at
midday you will be in time to welcome Miss Merrill.”</p>

<p>This did not meet with Cheyne’s approval. He wished
to go himself to the mysterious house with Blessington,
but the latter politely but firmly conveyed to him that he
had not yet irrevocably committed himself on their side,
and until he had done so they could not give away their
best chance of escape should the police become interested
in their movements. Cheyne argued with some bitterness,
but the other side held the trumps, and he was obliged to
give way.</p>

<p>This point settled, nothing could have exceeded the
easy friendliness of the trio. If Arnold Price were alive he
would share equally with the rest. Would Mr. Cheyne
come to the study while the formalities were got through?
Did he consider this oath—typewritten—would meet the
case? Well, they would take it first, binding themselves
individually to each other and to him. Each of the three
swore loyalty to the remaining quintet, the oaths of Joan
Merrill and Susan being assumed for the moment. Then
Cheyne swore and they all solemnly shook hands.</p>

<p>“Now that’s done, Mr. Cheyne, we’ll prove our confidence
in you by showing you the cipher. But first perhaps you
would write to Miss Merrill. Also if any point is not quite
clear to you please do not hesitate to question us.”</p>

<p>Cheyne was by no means enamored of the way things
had turned out. He had been forced into an association
with men with whom he had little in common and whom
he did not trust. Had it not been for the trump card they
held in the person of Joan Merrill nothing would have
induced him to throw in his lot with them. But now,
contingent on their good faith to him, he had pledged his
word, and though he was not sure how far an enforced
pledge was binding, he felt that as long as they kept their
part of the bargain, he must keep his. He therefore wrote
his letter, and then turning to Blessington, answered him
civilly:</p>

<p>“There is one thing I should like to know; I have
thought about it many times. How did you drug me in
that hotel in Plymouth without my knowledge and without
leaving any traces in the food?”</p>

<p>Blessington smiled.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you that with pleasure, Mr. Cheyne,” he
answered readily, “but I confess I am surprised that a man
of your acumen was puzzled by it. It depended upon
prearrangement, and given that, was perfectly simple. I
provided myself with the drug—if you don’t mind I won’t
say how, as I might get someone else into trouble—but I
got a small phial of it. I also took two other small bottles,
one full of clean water, the other empty, together with a
small cloth. Also I took my Extra Special Flask. Sime, like
a good fellow, get my flask out of the drawer of my
wrecked escritoire.” He smiled ruefully at Cheyne. “Then
I prepared for our lunch: the private room, the menu and
all complete. I told them at the hotel we had some
business to arrange, and that we didn’t want to be disturbed
after lunch. You know, of course, that I got all details of
your movements from Miss Dangle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand that.”</p>

<p>As Cheyne spoke Sime re-entered the room, putting
down on the table the flask which had figured in the scene
at the hotel. Blessington handed it to Cheyne.</p>

<p>“Examine that flask, Mr. Cheyne,” he invited. “Do you
see anything remarkable about it?”</p>

<p>It seemed an ordinary silver pocket flask, square and
flat, and with a screw-down silver stopper. It was chased
on both sides with a plain but rather pleasing design, and
the base was flat so that it would stand securely. But
Cheyne could see nothing about it in any way unusual.</p>

<p>“Open it,” Blessington suggested.</p>

<p>Cheyne unscrewed the stopper and looked down the
neck, but except that there was a curious projection at one
side, which reduced the passage down to half the usual
size, it seemed as other flasks. Blessington laughed.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Two diagrams of a flask, divided down the middle and containing liquids in both parts. In the second diagram, the flask is tipped, and liquid pours from the right half only." src="images/flasks.png" id="img_images_flasks.png"/>
</figure>

<p>“Look here,” he said, and seizing a scrap of paper, he
drew the two sketches which I reproduce. “The flask is
divided down the middle by a diaphragm <i>C</i>, so as to form
two chambers, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. In these chambers are put two
liquids, of which one is drugged and the other isn’t. <i>E</i>
and <i>F</i> are two half diaphragms, and <i>D</i> is a very light and
delicately fitted flap valve which will close the passage to
either chamber. When you invert the flask, the liquid in
the upper or <i>B</i> chamber runs out along diaphragm <i>C</i>,
and its weight turns over valve D so that the passage to <i>A</i>
chamber is closed. The liquid from <i>B</i> then pours out in
the ordinary way. The liquid in <i>A</i>, however, cannot escape,
because it is caught by the diaphragm <i>F</i>. If you want to
pour out the liquid from <i>A</i> you simply turn the flask upside
down, when the conditions as to the two liquids are
reversed. You probably didn’t notice that I used the flask
in this way at our lunch. You may remember that I poured
out your liqueur first—it was drugged, of course. Then I
got a convenient fit of coughing. That gave me an excuse
to set down the flask and pick it up again, but when I
picked it up I was careful to do so by the other side, so
that undrugged liqueur poured into my own cup. I drank
my coffee at once to reassure you. Simple, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“More than simple,” Cheyne answered with unwilling
admiration in his tone. “A dangerous toy, but I admit,
deuced ingenious. But I don’t follow even yet. That would
have left the drugged remains in the cup.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, but you have forgotten my other two bottles
and my cloth. I poured the dregs from your cup into the
empty bottle, washed the cup with water from the other,
wiped it with my cloth, poured out another cup of coffee
and drank it, leaving harmless grounds for any inquisitive
analyst to experiment with.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” said Cheyne, then adding regretfully: “If we
had only tried the handle of the cup for fingerprints!”</p>

<p>“I put gloves on after you went over.”</p>

<p>Cheyne smiled.</p>

<p>“You deserved to succeed,” he admitted ruefully.</p>

<p>“I succeeded in drugging you,” Blessington answered,
“but I did not succeed in getting what I wanted. Now,
Mr. Cheyne, you would like to see the tracing. Show it to
him, Dangle, while I go back to the other house for Miss
Merrill.”</p>

<p>Dangle left the room, returning presently with the
blue-gray sheet which had been the pivot upon which all the
strange adventures of the little company had turned.
Cheyne saw at a glance it was the tracing which he had
secured in the upper room in the house in Hopefield
Avenue. There in the corners were the holes made by the
drawing-pins which had fixed it to the door while it was
being photographed. There were the irregularly spaced
circles, with their letters and numbers, and there, written
clockwise in a large circle, the words: “England expects
every man to do his duty.” Cheyne gazed at it with interest,
while Dangle and Sime sat watching him. What on earth
could it mean? He pondered awhile, then turned to his
companions.</p>

<p>“Have you not been able to read any of it?” he queried.</p>

<p>Dangle shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not so much as a single word—not a letter even!” he
declared. “I tell you, Mr. Cheyne, it’s a regular sneezer!
I wouldn’t like to say how many hours we’ve spent—all of
us—working at it. And I don’t think there’s a book on
ciphers in the whole of London that we haven’t read. And
not a glimmer of light from any of them! Blessington had
a theory that each of these circles was intended to
represent one or more atoms, according to the number it
contained, and that certain circles could be grouped to make
molecules of the various substances that were to be mixed
with the copper. I never could quite understand his idea,
but in any case all our work hasn’t helped us to find them.
The truth is that we’re stale. We want a fresh brain on it,
and particularly a woman’s brain. Sometimes a woman’s
intuition will lead her to a lucky guess. We hope it may
in this case.”</p>

<p>He paused, then went on again: “Another thing we tried
was this. Suppose that by some system of numerical
substitution each of these numbers represents a letter. Then
groups of these letters together with the letters already in
the circles should represent words. Of course it is difficult
to group them, though we tried again and again. At first
the idea seemed promising, but we could make nothing of
it. We couldn’t find any system either of substitution or of
grouping which would give a glimmering of sense. No,
we’re up against it and no mistake, and when we think of
the issues involved we go nearly mad from exasperation.
Take the thing, Mr. Cheyne, and see what you and Miss
Merrill can do. That is the original, but I have made a
tracing of it, so that we can continue our work
simultaneously.”</p>

<p>Cheyne felt himself extraordinarily thrilled by this
recital, and the more he examined the mysterious
markings on the sheet the more interested he grew. He had
always had a <i>penchant</i> for puzzles, and ciphers appealed
to him as being perhaps the most alluring kind of puzzles
extant. Particularly did this cipher attract him because of
the circumstances under which it had been brought to his
notice. He longed to get to grips with it, and he looked
forward with keen delight to a long afternoon and evening
over it with Joan Merrill, whose interest in it would, he
felt sure, be no whit less than his own.</p>

<p>Certainly, he thought, his former enemies had made a
good beginning. So far they were playing the game, and he
began to wonder if he had not to some extent misjudged
them, and if the evil characters given them by the gloomy
Speedwell were not tinged by that despondent individual’s
jaundiced outlook on life in general.</p>

<p>Dangle had left the room, and he now returned with a
bottle of whisky and a box of cigars.</p>

<p>“A drink and a cigar to cement our alliance, Mr.
Cheyne,” he proposed, “and then I think our business will
be done.”</p>

<p>Cheyne hesitated, while a vision of the private room in
the Edgecombe Hotel rose in his memory. Dangle read his
thoughts, for he smiled and went on:</p>

<p>“I see you don’t quite trust us yet, and I don’t know that
I can blame you. But we really are all right this time.
Examine these tumblers and then pour out the stuff
yourself, and we’ll drink ours first. We must get you convinced
of our goodwill.”</p>

<p>Cheyne hesitated, but Dangle insisting, he demonstrated
to his satisfaction that his companions drank the same
mixture as himself. Then Dangle opened the cigar box.</p>

<p>“These are specially good, though I say it myself. The
box was given to Blessington by a rich West Indian
planter. We only smoke them on state occasions, such as the
present. Won’t you take one?”</p>

<p>Cheyne felt it would be churlish to refuse, and soon the
three were puffing such tobacco as Cheyne at all events had
seldom before smoked. Sime then excused himself, explaining
that though business might be neglected it could not be
entirely ignored, and Cheyne, thereupon taking the hint,
said that he too must be off.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow we shall be kept late in town,” Dangle
explained, as they stood on the doorstep, “but the next
evening we shall be here. Will you and Miss Merrill come
down and report progress, and let us have a council of
war?”</p>

<p>Cheyne agreed and was turning away, when Dangle
made a sudden gesture.</p>

<p>“By George! I was forgetting,” he cried. “Wait a
second, Mr. Cheyne.”</p>

<p>He disappeared back into the house, returning a
moment later with a small purse, which he handed to
Cheyne.</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know if that is Miss Merrill’s?” he
inquired. “It was found beside the chair in which we
placed her last night when we carried her in.”</p>

<p>Cheyne recognized the article at once. He had
frequently seen Joan use it.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s hers,” he answered, to which Dangle replied
asking if he would take it for her.</p>

<p>Cheyne slipped the purse into his pocket, and next
moment he was walking along Dalton Road towards the
station, free, well, and with the tracing in his pocket. Until
that moment, in the inner recesses of his consciousness
doubt of the <i>bona fides</i> of the trio had lingered. Until
then the fear that he was to be the victim of some
plausible trick had dwelt in his heart. But now at last he
was convinced. Had the men desired to harm him they
had had a perfect opportunity. He had been for the last
hour entirely in their power. No one knew where he had
gone, and they could with the greatest ease have
murdered him, and either hidden his body about the house or
garden or removed it in the car during the night. Yes, this
time he believed their story. It was eminently reasonable,
and as a matter of fact, it had been pretty well proved by
their actions, as well as by the facts that he had learned
at the Admiralty and elsewhere. They were at a standstill
because they couldn’t read the cipher, and they really did
want, as they said, the help of his and Joan’s fresh brains.
From their point of view they had done a wise thing in
thus approaching him—indeed, a masterly thing. Cheyne
was not conceited and he did not consider his own mental
powers phenomenal, but he knew he was good at puzzles,
and at the very least, he and Joan were of average
intelligence. Moreover, they were the only other persons who
knew of the cipher, and it was the soundest strategy to turn
their antagonism into cooperation.</p>

<p>He reached North Wembley to find a train about to start
for Town, and some half hour later he was walking up
the platform at Euston. He looked at his watch. It was
barely eleven. An hour would elapse before Joan would
reach her rooms, and that meant that he had more than
half an hour to while away before going to meet her. It
occurred to him that in his excitement he had forgotten
to breakfast, and though he was not hungry, he thought
another cup of coffee would not be unacceptable.
Moreover, he could at the same time have a look over the
cipher. He therefore went to the refreshment room, gave
his order, and sat down at a table in a secluded corner.
Then drawing the mysterious sheet from his pocket, he
began to examine it.</p>

<p>As he leaned forward over his coffee he felt Joan’s purse
in his pocket, and suddenly fearful lest in his eagerness to
tell her his experiences he should forget to give it to her,
he took it out and laid it on the table, intending to carry
it in his hand until he met her. Then he returned to his
study of the tracing.</p>

<p>There are those who tell us that in this world there are
no trifles: that every event, however unimportant it may
appear, is preordained and weighty as every other. On this
bright spring morning in the first class refreshment room
at Euston, Cheyne was to meet with a demonstration of
the truth of this assertion which left him marveling and
humbly thankful. For there took place what seemed to be
a trifling thing, and yet that trifle proved to be the most
important event that had ever taken place, or was to take
place, in his life.</p>

<p>When he took his first sip of coffee he found that he
had forgotten to put sugar in it, and when he looked at the
sugar bowl he saw that by the merest chance it was empty.
An empty sugar bowl. A trifle that, if ever there was one!
And yet nothing of more supreme moment had ever
happened to Cheyne than the finding of that empty bowl on
his table at that moment.</p>

<p>The sugar bowl, then, being empty, he picked it up with
his free hand and carried it across to the counter to ask
the barmaid to fill it. Scarcely had he done so when there
came from behind him an appalling explosion. There was
a reverberating crash mingled with the tinkle of falling
glass, while a sharp blast of air swept past him, laden with
the pungent smell of some burned chemical. He wheeled
round, the shrill screams of the barmaids in his ears, to see
the corner of the room where he had been sitting, in
complete wreckage. Through a fog of smoke and dust he saw
that his table and chair were nonexistent, neighboring
tables and chairs were overturned, the window was gone,
hat-racks, pictures, wall advertisements were heaped in
broken and torn confusion, while over all was spread a
coat of plaster which had been torn from the wall. On the
floor lay a man who had been seated at an adjoining table,
the only other occupant of that part of the room.</p>

<p>For a moment no one moved, and then there came a rush
of feet from without, and a number of persons burst into
the room. Porters, ticket collectors, a guard, and several
members of the public came crowding in, staring with
round eyes and open mouths at the debris. Eager hands
helped to raise the prostrate man, who appeared to be more
or less seriously injured, while hurried questions were
bandied from lip to lip.</p>

<p>It did not need the barmaid’s half hysterical cry: “Why,
it was your purse; I saw it go,” to make clear to Cheyne
what had happened, and as he grasped the situation his
heart melted within him and a great fear took possession
of his mind. Once again these dastardly scoundrels had
hoaxed him! Their oaths, their protestations of friendship,
their talk of an alliance—all were a sham! They were out
to murder him. The purse they had evidently stolen from
Joan, filling it with explosives, with some time
agent—probably chemical—to make it go off at the proper
moment. They had given it to him under conditions which
made it a practical certainty that at that moment it would
be in his pocket, when he would be blown to pieces
without leaving any clue as to the agency which had wrought
his destruction. He suddenly felt sick as he thought of the
whole hideous business.</p>

<p>But it was not contemplation of the fate he had so
narrowly escaped that sent his heart leaping into his throat
in deadly panic. If these unspeakable ruffians had tried to
murder him with their hellish explosives, what about Joan
Merrill? All the talk about driving her back to her rooms
must have been mere eyewash. She must be in deadly
peril—if it was not too late: if she was not already—Merciful
Heaven, he could not frame the thought!—if she
was not already <em>dead</em>! He burst into a cold sweat, as the
idea burned itself into his consciousness. And then suddenly
he knew the reason. He loved her! He loved this girl who
had saved his life and who had already proved herself such
a splendid comrade and helpmeet. His own life, the
wretched secret, the miserable pursuit of wealth, victory
over the gang—what were these worth? They were
forgotten—they were nothing—they were less than nothing! It
was Joan and Joan’s safety that filled his mind. “Oh,
God,” he murmured in an agony, “save her, save her! No
matter about anything else, only save her!”</p>

<p>He stood, leaning against the counter, overcome with
these thoughts. Then the need for immediate action
brought him to his senses. Perhaps it was not too late.
Perhaps something might yet be done. Scotland Yard!
That was his only hope. Instantly he must go to Scotland
Yard and implore the help of the authorities.</p>

<p>He glanced round. Persons in authority were entering
and pushing to the front of the now dense crowd. That
surely was the stationmaster, and there was a policeman.
Cheyne did not want to be detained to answer questions.
He slipped rapidly into the throng, and by making way
for those behind to press forward, soon found himself on
its outskirts. In a few seconds he was on the platform and
in a couple of minutes he was in a taxi driving towards
Westminster as fast as a promise of double fare could take
him.</p>

<p>He raced into the great building on the Embankment
and rather incoherently stated his business. He was asked
to sit down, and after waiting what seemed to him
interminable ages, but what was really something under five
minutes, he was told that Inspector French would see him.
Would he please come this way.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch13">

<h2>Chapter XIII. <br/> Inspector French Takes Charge</h2>

<p>Cheyne was ushered into a small, plainly furnished room,
in which at a table-desk was seated a rather stout,
clean-shaven man with a cheerful, good humored face and the
suggestion of a twinkle about his eye. He stood up as
Cheyne entered, looked him over critically with a pair of
very keen dark blue eyes, and then smiled.</p>

<p>“Mr. Maxwell Cheyne?” he said genially. “I am Inspector
French. You wish to consult us? Now just sit down
there and tell me your trouble, and we’ll do what we can
for you.”</p>

<p>His manner was kindly and pleasant and did much to
set Cheyne at his ease. The young man had been rather
dreading his visit, expecting to be met with the harsh,
incredulous, unsympathetic attitude of officialdom. But
this inspector, with his easy manners, and his apparently
human outlook, was quite different from his anticipation.
He felt drawn to him and realized with relief that at least
he would get a sympathetic hearing.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said, trying to speak calmly. “It’s very
good of you, I’m sure. I’m in great trouble—not about
myself, that is, but about my—my friend, a lady, Miss
Joan Merrill. I’m afraid she is in terrible danger, if indeed
it is not too late.”</p>

<p>“Tell me the details.” The man was all attention, and
his quiet decisive manner induced confidence.</p>

<p>Curbing his impatience, Cheyne related his adventures.
In the briefest outline he told of the drugging in the
Plymouth hotel, of the burglary at Warren Lodge, of his
involuntary trip on the <i>Enid</i>, of his journey to London and his
adventure in the house in Hopefield Avenue. Then he
described Joan Merrill’s welcome intervention, his
convalescence in the hospital, the compact between himself
and Joan, his visit to Speedwell, and his burglary of
Earlswood. He recounted Dangle’s appearance as an envoy, the
meeting with the gang, and the explosion at Euston, and
finally voiced the terrible suggestion which this latter
contained as to the possible fate of Joan.</p>

<p>Inspector French listened to his recital with an
appearance of the keenest interest.</p>

<p>“You have certainly had an unusual experience, Mr.
Cheyne,” he remarked. “I don’t know that I can recall a
similar case. Now I think we may take it that Miss
Merrill’s safety is our first concern. We shall go out to this
house, Earlswood, and see if we can learn anything about
her there. The other activities of the gang must wait.
Excuse me a moment.” He gave some orders through his
desk telephone, resuming: “I should think the house has
probably been vacated: these people would cover their
traces until they learned from the papers that you had
been killed. However, we’ll soon know that. Wait here
until I arrange about warrants, and then we’ll start.”</p>

<p>He disappeared for some minutes, while Cheyne fretted
and chafed and tried to control his impatience. Then he
returned, and slipping an automatic pistol into his pocket,
invited Cheyne to follow him.</p>

<p>He led the way downstairs and out into a courtyard in
the great building. Two motorcars were just drawing up
at the curb, while at the same moment no less than eight
plain clothes men appeared from another door. The party
having taken their places, the two vehicles slid out through
a covered way into the traffic of the town.</p>

<p>“We shall go round to Chelsea first,” French explained,
“and make sure there is no news of Miss Merrill.”</p>

<p>As they ran quickly through the busy streets, French
asked a series of questions on points of Cheyne’s
statement upon which he desired further information. “If this
trip draws blank, as I fear it will,” he observed, “I shall
want you to tell me your story again, this time with all
the detail you can possibly put into it. For the moment
there’s not time for that.”</p>

<p>At Horne Terrace there was no trace or tidings of
Joan. It was by this time half past twelve, half an hour
after the time at which Blessington had promised she
should be there, and Cheyne felt all his forebodings
confirmed. But he was not surprised, feeling but the more
eager to push on to Wembley.</p>

<p>On the way French made him draw a sketch map of
the position of Earlswood, and on nearing his goal he
stopped the cars, and calling his men together, explained
exactly what was to be done. Then telling Cheyne to sit
with the driver and direct him to the front gate, they
again mounted and went forward. At a good rate they
swung into Dalton Road, and Cheyne pointing the way,
his car stopped at the gate, while the other ran on down
the cross-road to the lane at the back. The men sprang
out, and in less time than it takes to tell, the house was
surrounded.</p>

<p>Cheyne followed French as he hurried up to the door
and gave a thundering knock. There was no answer, and
walking round the house, the two men examined the
windows. These being all fastened, French turned his
attention to the back door, and after two or three minutes’
work with a bunch of skeleton keys the bolt shot back,
and followed by Cheyne and two of his men, he entered
the house.</p>

<p>A short search revealed the fact that the birds had
flown, hurriedly, it seemed, as everything had been left
exactly as during Cheyne’s visit. On the table in the
sitting room stood the glasses from which they had drunk
their whisky, the box of cigars lay open beside them and
the chairs were still drawn up to the table. But there was
no sign of Sime or Dangle, and a hurried look round
revealed no clue to their whereabouts.</p>

<p>“I feared as much,” French commented, as he sent a
constable to call in the men who were surrounding the
house, “but we have still two strings to our bow.” He
turned to the others, and rapidly gave his orders. “You,
Hinckston and Tucker, remain here and arrest any one
who enters this house. Simmons, go to Locke Street, off
Southampton Row, and find Speedwell, of Horton &amp;
Lavender’s Detective Agency. You know him, don’t you?
Well, find him and tell him this affair has developed into
attempted murder and abduction, and ask him can he
give any information to the Yard. Tell him I’m in charge.
The rest of you come with me to—what did Speedwell
give you as Sime’s address, Mr. Cheyne? . . . All right, I
have it here—to 12 Colton Street, Putney. We shall carry
out the same plan there, surround the house, and then
enter and search it. All got that? Come along, Mr.
Cheyne.”</p>

<p>They hurried back to the cars and were soon
running—somewhat over the legal speed—back to town. French,
though he had shown energy enough at Earlswood, was
willing to chat now in a pleasant, leisurely way, though
he continued to interlard his remarks with questions on the
details of Cheyne’s story. Then he took over the tracing,
and examined it curiously. “I’ll have a go at this later,”
he said, as he put it in his pocket, “but I can scarcely
believe they would have given you the genuine article.”</p>

<p>Cheyne would have questioned this opinion, reminding
his companion he had seen the tracing pinned up to be
photographed in the house in Hopefield Avenue, but just
then they swung into Colton Street, and the time for
conversation had passed. Contrary to his expectation they ran
past No. 12 without slackening, turned down the first side
street beyond it, and there came to a stand.</p>

<p>“There’s the end of the passage behind the house,”
French pointed when his men had dismounted. “Carter
and Jones and Marshall go down there and watch the
back. No doubt you counted and know it’s the eighth
house. You other two men and you, Mr. Cheyne, come
with me.”</p>

<p>He turned back into Colton Street and with his three
followers strode rapidly up to No. 12. It was like its
neighbors, a small two-storied single terrace house of
old-fashioned design. Indeed the narrow road, with its two grimy
rows of almost working-class dwellings, seemed more like
one of those terrible streets built in the last century in the
slum districts of provincial towns, than a bit of
mid-London.</p>

<p>A peremptory knock from French producing no result,
he had once more recourse to his skeleton keys. This door
was easier to negotiate than the last, and in less than a
minute it swung open and the four men entered the
house.</p>

<p>On the right of the hall was a tiny sitting room, and
there they found the remains of what appeared to have
been a hastily prepared meal. Four chairs were drawn up
to the small central table, on which were part of a loaf,
butter, an empty sardine tin, egg shells, two cups containing
tea leaves and two glasses smelling of whisky. French
put his hand on the teapot. “Feel that, Mr. Cheyne,” he
exclaimed. “They can’t be far away.”</p>

<p>The teapot was warm, and when Cheyne looked into
the kitchen adjoining, he found that the kettle on the gas
ring was also warm, though the ring itself had grown cold.
If the four lunchers were Blessington and Co., as seemed
indubitable, they must indeed be close by, and Cheyne
grew hot with eager excitement as he thought that French
and he might be within reasonable sight of their goal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile French and his men had carried out a rapid
search of the house, without result except to prove that
once more the birds had flown. But as to the direction
which their flight had taken there was no clue.</p>

<p>“I don’t expect we’ll see them back,” French said to
Cheyne, “but we must take no chances.” He turned to his
men. “Jones and Marshall, stay here in the house and arrest
any one who enters. You, Carter, make inquiries in these
houses to the right, and you, Hobbs, do the same to the
left. Come, Mr. Cheyne, you and I will try the other side
of the street.”</p>

<p>They crossed to the house opposite, and French knocked.
The door was opened by a young woman who seemed
thrilled by French’s statement that he was a police officer
making inquiries about the occupiers of No. 12, but who
was unable to give him any useful information about them.
A man lived there—she believed his name was Sime—but
she did not know either himself or anything about him.
No, she hadn’t seen any recent arrivals or departures. She
had been engaged at the back of the house during the
whole morning and had not looked out across the street.
Yes, she believed Sime lived alone except for an elderly
housekeeper. As far as she knew he was quite respectable,
at least she had never heard anything against him.</p>

<p>Politely thanking her, French tried the next house. Here
he found a small girl who said she had looked out some
half an hour previously and had seen a yellow motor
standing before No. 12. But she had not seen it arrive or depart,
nor anyone get in or out.</p>

<p>French tried five houses without result, but at the sixth
he had a stroke of luck.</p>

<p>In this house it appeared that there was a chronic
invalid, a sister of the woman who opened the door. This
poor creature was confined permanently to bed, and in
the hope of relieving the tedium of the days, she had had
the bed drawn close to her window, so as to extract what
amusement she could from the life of the street. If there
had been any unusual happenings in front of No. 12, she
would certainly have witnessed them. Yes, the woman
was sure her sister would see the visitors.</p>

<p>“Lucky chance, that,” French said, as they waited to
know if they might go up. “If this woman’s eyes and brain
are unaffected she’ll have become an accurate observer,
and we’ll probably learn all there is to know.”</p>

<p>In a moment the sister appeared beckoning, and going
upstairs they found in a small front room a bed drawn up
to the window, in which lay a superior looking elderly
woman with a pale patient face, lined by suffering, in
which shone a pair of large dark intelligent eyes. She was
propped up the better to see out, and her face lighted up
with interest at her unexpected callers, as she laid down
among the books on the coverlet an intricate looking
piece of fancy sewing.</p>

<p>Inspector French bowed to her.</p>

<p>“I’d like to say how much I appreciate your kindness in
letting us come up, madam,” he said with his pleasant
kindly smile, “but when you hear that we are trying to
find a young lady who we fear has been kidnaped, I am
sure you will be glad to help us. The matter is connected
with No. 12 opposite. Can you tell me if any persons
arrived or left it this morning?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I can,” the invalid replied in cultivated tones—a
lady born, though fallen on evil days, thought Cheyne—“I
like to watch the people passing and I did notice
arrivals and departures at No. 12. About, let me see—half
past eleven, or perhaps a minute or two later a motor
drove up to No. 12, a yellow car, fair size and covered in.
Three men got out and went into the house. One was Mr.
Sime, who lives there, the others I didn’t know. Mr. Sime
opened the door with his latch-key. In a couple of minutes
one of the strangers came out again, got into the car, and
drove off.”</p>

<p>“That the car you saw outside Earlswood, Mr. Cheyne?”
asked French.</p>

<p>“Certain to be,” Cheyne nodded. “It was a yellow
covered-in car of medium size, No. XL7305.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t observe the number,” the lady remarked. “The
bonnet was facing towards me.”</p>

<p>“What was the driver like, madam?” queried Cheyne.</p>

<p>“One of Mr. Sime’s companions drove. He was short
and rather stout, with a round face, and what, I believe,
is called a toothbrush mustache.”</p>

<p>“That’s Blessington all right. And was the third man of
medium height and build, with a clean-shaven, somewhat
rugged face?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that exactly describes him.”</p>

<p>“And that’s Dangle. There’s no question about the
party, Inspector.”</p>

<p>“None. Then, madam, you saw—?”</p>

<p>“That, as I said, was about half-past eleven. About
half-past one the man you have called Blessington came back
with the car. He got out, left it, and went into the house.
In about a quarter of an hour he came out again and
started his engine. Then the other two men followed,
assisting a young lady who appeared to be very weak and
ill. She seemed scarcely able to walk, and they almost
carried her. Another girl followed, who drew the door of the
house after her.”</p>

<p>Cheyne started on hearing these words, and looked with
an agonized expression at the Inspector. “What were they
like, these women?” he breathed through his dry lips.</p>

<p>But both men knew the answer. The girl assisted out by
Sime and Dangle was undoubtedly Joan Merrill, and the
other equally certainly was Susan Dangle.</p>

<p>“She was lame—the one you thought ill?” Cheyne
persisted. “She had twisted her ankle.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” the lady returned, “but I do not think so.
She seemed to me to step equally well on each foot. It was
more as if she was half asleep or very weak. Her head
hung forward and she did not seem to notice where she
was going.”</p>

<p>Cheyne made a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>“Heavens above!” he cried hoarsely. “What have they
done to her?”</p>

<p>“Drugged her,” French answered succinctly. “But you
should take courage from that, Mr. Cheyne. It looks as if
they didn’t mean to do her a personal injury. Yes,
madam?”</p>

<p>Before the invalid could speak Cheyne went on, a
puzzled note in his voice.</p>

<p>“But look here,” he said slowly, “I don’t understand
this. You say that the sick lady was wearing a fur coat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a musquash fur.”</p>

<p>“But—” He looked at French in perplexity. “Miss
Merrill has a fur coat like that—I’ve seen it. But she wasn’t
wearing it last night. Can it be someone else after all?”
His voice took on a dawning eagerness.</p>

<p>French shook his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t build too much on that, Mr. Cheyne. They may
have lent her a coat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but why should they? She had a coat last night, a
perfectly warm coat of brown cloth. She wouldn’t want
another.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps her own got muddy when she fell. We’ll have
to leave it at that for the moment. We’ll consider it later.
Let’s get on now and hear what this lady can tell us. Yes,
madam, if you please?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid there is not much more to be told. All five
got into the car and drove off.”</p>

<p>“In which direction?”</p>

<p>“Eastwards.”</p>

<p>“That is to say, they have just left about half an hour.
We were only fifteen minutes behind them, Mr. Cheyne.”</p>

<p>He got up to go, but the lady motioned him back to his
seat.</p>

<p>“There is one other thing I have just remembered,” she
said. “It may or may not have something to do with the
affair. Last night—it must have been about half-past
eleven—I heard a motor in the street. It stopped for
about ten minutes, though the engine ran all the time, then
went off again. I didn’t look out, but now that I come to
think about it it sounded as if it might be standing at No.
12. Of course you understand that is only a guess, but
motorcars are somewhat rare visitors to this street, and
there may have been some connection.”</p>

<p>“Extremely probable, I should think, madam,” French
commented. He rose. “Now we must be off to act on what
you have told us. I needn’t say that you have placed us
very greatly in your debt.”</p>

<p>“It was but little I could do,” the lady returned. “I do
hope you may be able to help that poor girl. I should be
so glad to hear that she is all right.”</p>

<p>Cheyne was touched by this unexpected sympathy.</p>

<p>“You may count on my letting you know, madam,” he
said, and then thinking of the terribly monotonous
existence led by the poor soul, he went on warmly: “I
should like, if I might, to call and tell you all about it, but
if I am prevented I shall certainly write. May I know what
name to address to?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Sproule, 17 Colton Street. I should be glad to see
you if you are in this district, but I couldn’t think of taking
you out of your way.”</p>

<p>A few moments later French had collected his three
remaining men, and was being driven rapidly to the
nearest telephone call office. There he rang up the Yard,
repeated the descriptions of the car and of each of its
occupants, and asked for the police force generally to be
advised that they were wanted, particularly the men on
duty at railway stations and wharves, not only in London,
but in the surrounding country.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll have a shot at picking up the trail
ourselves,” he went on to Cheyne when he had sent his
message. He re-entered the car, calling to the driver: “Get
back and find the men on point duty round about Colton
Street.”</p>

<p>Of the four men they interviewed, three had not noticed
the yellow car. The fourth, on a beat in the thoroughfare
at the eastern end of Colton Street, had seen a car of the
size and color in question going eastwards at about the
hour the party had left No. 12. There seeming nothing
abnormal about the vehicle, he had not specially observed
it or noted the number, but he had looked at the driver,
and the man he described resembled Blessington.</p>

<p>“That’s probably it all right,” French commented, “but
it doesn’t help us a great deal. If they were going to any of
the stations or steamers, or to practically anywhere in
town, this is the way they would pass. Let us try a step
further.”</p>

<p>Keeping in the same general direction they searched for
other men on point duty, but though after a great deal of
running backwards and forwards, they found all in the
immediate neighborhood that the car would have been
likely to pass, none of them had noticed it.</p>

<p>“We’ve lost them, I’m afraid,” French said at last. “We
had better go back to the Yard. As soon as that
description gets out we may have news at any minute.”</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later they passed once more
through the corridors of the great building which houses
the C.I.D., and reached French’s room. There sitting
waiting for them was the melancholy private detective,
Speedwell. He rose as they entered.</p>

<p>“Afternoon, Mr. French. Afternoon, Mr. Cheyne,” he
said ingratiatingly, rubbing his hands together. “I got your
message, Mr. French, and I thought I’d better call round.
Of course I’ll tell you anything I can to help.”</p>

<p>French beamed on him.</p>

<p>“Now that was good of you, Speedwell; very good. I’ll
not forget it. Did Simmons tell you what had happened?”</p>

<p>“Not in detail—only that Blessington, Sime, and the
Dangles were wanted.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Cheyne here and Miss Merrill were out there
last night,” he shook his head reproachfully at Cheyne
while a twinkle showed in his eyes, “and your friends got
hold of Miss Merrill and we can’t find her. Mr. Cheyne
they enticed into the house with a fair story. They led him
to believe that Miss Merrill would be in her studio when
he got back to town and gave him her purse, which they
said she had dropped. It contained a time bomb, and only
the merest chance saved Mr. Cheyne from being blown
to bits. There are charges against the quartet of attempted
murder of Mr. Cheyne, and of abduction of Miss Merrill.
Can you help us at all?”</p>

<p>Speedwell shook his head.</p>

<p>“I doubt it, Mr. French, I doubt it, sir. I found out a
little, not very much. But all the information I have is at
your disposal.”</p>

<p>Cheyne stared at him.</p>

<p>“But how can that be?” he exclaimed. “You were in
their confidence—to some extent at all events. Surely you
got some hint of what they were after?”</p>

<p>Speedwell made a deferential movement, and his smile
became still more oily and ingratiating.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Cheyne, sir, you mustn’t think too much of
that. That was what we might call in the way of business.”
He glanced sideways at Cheyne from his little foxy
close-set eyes. “You can’t complain, sir, but what I answered
your questions, and you’ll admit you got value for your
money.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you,” Cheyne returned sharply. “Do
you mean that that tale you told me was a lie, and that
you weren’t employed by these people to find the man who
burgled their house?”</p>

<p>Speedwell rubbed his hands together more vigorously.</p>

<p>“A little business expedient, sir, merely an ordinary little
business expedient. It would be a foolish man who would
not display his wares to the best advantage. I’m sure, sir,
you’ll agree with that.”</p>

<p>Cheyne looked at him fiercely for a moment.</p>

<p>“You infernal rogue!” he burst out hotly. “Then your
tale to me was a tissue of lies, and on the strength of it you
cheated me out of my money! Now you’ll hand that £150
back! Do you hear that?”</p>

<p>Speedwell’s smile became the essence of craftiness.</p>

<p>“Not so fast, sir, not so fast,” he purred. “There’s no
need to use unpleasant language. You asked for a thing
and agreed to pay a certain price. You got what you asked
for, and you paid the price you agreed. There was no
cheating there.”</p>

<p>Cheyne was about to retort, but French, suave and
courteous, broke in:</p>

<p>“Well, we can talk of that afterwards. I think, Mr.
Cheyne, that Mr. Speedwell has made us a satisfactory
offer. He says he will tell us everything he knows. For my
part I am obliged to him for that, as he is not bound to
say anything at all. I think you will agree that we ought
to thank him for the position he is taking up, and to hear
what he has to say. Now, Speedwell, if you are ready. Take
a cigar first, and make yourself comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. French. I am always glad, as you
know, sir, to assist the Yard or the police. I haven’t much
to tell you, but here is the whole of it.”</p>

<p>He lit his cigar, settled himself in his chair, and began
to speak.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV. <br/> The Clue of the Clay-marked Shoe</h2>

<p>“You know, Mr. French,” said Speedwell, “about my
being called in by the manager of the Edgecombe in
Plymouth when Mr. Cheyne was drugged? Mr. Cheyne
has told you about that, sir?” French nodded and the
other went on: “Then I need only tell you what Mr.
Cheyne presumably does not know. I may just explain
before beginning that I came into contact with Mr.
Jesse, the manager, over some diamonds which were lost
by a visitor to the hotel and which I had the good fortune
to recover.</p>

<p>“The first point that struck me about Mr. Cheyne’s
little affair was, How did the unknown man know Mr.
Cheyne was going to lunch at that hotel on that day? I
found out from Mr. Cheyne that he hadn’t mentioned his
visit to Plymouth to anyone outside of his own
household, and I found out from Mrs. and Miss Cheyne that
they hadn’t either. But Miss Cheyne said it had been
discussed at lunch, and that gave me the tip. If these
statements were all O.K. it followed that the leakage must
have been through the servants and I had a chat with
both, just to see what they were like. The two were quite
different. The cook was good-humored and stupid and
easy going, and wouldn’t have the sense to run a
conspiracy with anyone, but the parlormaid was an able
young woman as well up as any I’ve met. So it looked as
if it must be her.</p>

<p>“Then I thought over the burglary, and it seemed to me
that the burglars must have got inside help, and if so, there
again Susan was the girl. Of course there was the tying up,
but that would be the natural way to work a blind. I
noticed that the cook’s wrists were swollen, but Susan’s
weren’t marked at all, so I questioned the cook, and I got
a bit of information out of her that pretty well proved
the thing. She said she heard the burglars ring and heard
Susan go to the door. But she said it was three or four
minutes before Susan screamed. Now if Susan’s story was
true she would have screamed far sooner than that, for,
according to her, the men had only asked could they write
a letter when they seized her. So that again looked like
Susan. You follow me, sir?”</p>

<p>Again French nodded, while Cheyne broke in: “You
never told me anything of that.”</p>

<p>Speedwell smiled once more his crafty smile.</p>

<p>“Well, no, Mr. Cheyne, I didn’t mention it certainly. It
was only a theory, you understand. I thought I’d wait till
I was sure.</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, there it was. Someone wanted some
paper that Mr. Cheyne had—it was almost certainly a
paper, as they searched his pocketbook—and Susan was
involved. I hung about Warren Lodge, and all the time
I was watching Susan. I found she wrote frequent letters
and always posted them herself: so that was suspicious too.
Then one day when she was out I slipped up to her room
and searched around. I found a writing case in her box
of much too good a kind for a servant, and a blotting-paper
pad with a lot of ink marks. When I put the pad
before a mirror I made out an address written several
times: ‘Mr. J. Dangle, Laurel Lodge, Hopefield Avenue,
Hendon.’ So that was that.”</p>

<p>Speedwell paused and glanced at his auditors in turn,
but neither replying, he resumed:</p>

<p>“I generally try to make a friend when I’m on a case:
they’re useful if you want some special information. So I
chummed up with the housemaid at Mrs. Hazelton’s—friends
of Mr. Cheyne’s—live quite close by. I told this
girl I was on the burglary job, and that there would be big
money in it if the thieves were caught, and that if she
helped me she should get her share. I told her I had my
suspicions of Susan, said I was going to London, and
asked her would she watch Susan and keep me advised of
how things went on. She said yes, and I gave her a couple
of pounds on account, just to keep her eager, while I came
back to town to look after Dangle.”</p>

<p>In spite of the keen interest with which he was listening
to these revelations, Cheyne felt himself seething with
indignant anger. How he had been hoodwinked by this
sneaking scoundrel, with his mean ingratiating smile and
his assumption of melancholy! He could have kicked
himself as he remembered how he had tried to cheer and
encourage the mock pessimist. He wondered which was
the more hateful, the man’s deceit or the cynical way he
was now telling of it. But, apparently unconscious of the
antagonism which he had aroused, Speedwell calmly and,
Cheyne thought disgustedly, a trifle proudly, continued his
narrative.</p>

<p>“I soon found that James Dangle lived at Laurel Lodge.
He was alone except for a daily char, but up till a short
while earlier his sister had kept house for him. When I
learned that his sister had left Laurel Lodge on the same
day that Susan took up her place at Warren Lodge, I soon
guessed who Susan really was.</p>

<p>“I thought that when these two would go to so much
trouble, the thing they were after must be pretty well
worth while, and I thought it might pay me if I could
find out what it was. So I shadowed Dangle, and learned
a good deal about him. I learned that he was constantly
meeting two other men, so I shadowed them and learned
they were Blessington and Sime. Blessington I guessed first
time I saw him was the man who had drugged you, Mr.
Cheyne, for he exactly covered your and the manager’s
descriptions. It seemed clear then that these three and
Susan Dangle—if her real name was Susan—were in the
conspiracy to get whatever you had.”</p>

<p>“But what I would like to have explained,” Cheyne burst
in, “was why you didn’t tell me what you had discovered.
You were paid to do it. What did you think you were
taking that hotel manager’s money for?”</p>

<p>Speedwell made a gesture of deferential disagreement.</p>

<p>“I scarcely think that you can find fault with me there,
Mr. Cheyne,” he answered with his ingratiating smile. “I
was investigating: I had not reached the end of my
investigation. As you will see, sir, my investigation took a
somewhat unexpected turn—a very unexpected turn, I
might almost say, which left me in a bit of doubt as to how
to act. But you’ll hear.”</p>

<p>Inspector French had been sitting quite still at his desk,
but now he stretched out his hand, took a cigar from the
box, and as he lit it, murmured: “Go on, Speedwell.
Sounds like a novel. I’m enjoying it. Aren’t you, Mr.
Cheyne?”</p>

<p>Cheyne made noncommittal noises, and Speedwell,
looking pleased, continued:</p>

<p>“One evening, nearly two months ago, I got back late
from another job and I found a wire waiting for me. It
was from Mrs. Hazelton’s housemaid and it said:
‘Maxwell Cheyne disappeared and Susan left Warren Lodge
for London.’ I thought to myself: ‘Bully for you, Jane,’
and then I thought: ‘Susan will be turning to Brother
James. I’ll go out to Hopefield Avenue and see if I can
pick anything up.’ So I went out. It was about half-past
ten when I arrived. I found the front of the house in
darkness, but an upper window at the back was lighted
up. There was a lane along behind the houses, you
understand, Mr. French, and a bit of garden between them and
the lane. The gate into the garden was open, and I slipped
in and began to tiptoe towards the house. Then I heard
soft steps coming in after me, and I turned aside and hid
behind a large shrub to see what would happen. And then
I saw something that interested me very much. A man
came in very quietly and I saw in the faint moonlight that
he was carrying a ladder.” There was an exclamation
from Cheyne. “He put the ladder to the lighted window
and climbed up, and then I saw who it was. I needn’t tell
you, Mr. Cheyne, I was surprised to see you, and I waited
behind the bush for what would happen. I saw and heard
the whole thing: the party coming down to supper, your
getting in, Sime coming out and seeing the ladder, the
alarm, your coming out, and them getting you on the head
in the garden. You’ll perhaps think, Mr. Cheyne, that I
should have come out and lent you a hand, but after all,
sir, I don’t know that you could claim that you had the
right of it altogether, and besides, it all happened so
quickly I had no chance to interfere. Well, anyhow they
knocked you out and then they searched you and took
a folded paper from your pocket. ‘Thank goodness, we’ve
got the tracing at all events,’ Dangle said, speaking very
softly, ‘but now we’re in the soup and no mistake. What
are we going to do with the confounded fool’s body?’
They examined the ladder and saw from the contractor’s
name that it had been brought from the new house, then
they whispered together and I couldn’t hear what was
said, but at last Sime said: ‘Right, we’ll fix it so that it
will look as if he fell off the ladder.’ Then the three men
picked you up, Mr. Cheyne, and carried you out down the
lane. Susan stood in the garden waiting, and I had to sit
tight behind the bush. In about ten minutes the men came
back and then Sime took the ladder and carried it away
down the lane. The others whispered together and then
Dangle said something to Susan, ending up: ‘It’s in the
second left hand drawer.’ She went indoors, but came out
again in a moment with a powerful electric torch.
Blessington and Dangle then searched for traces of your little
affair, Mr. Cheyne. They found the marks of the ladder
butts in the soft grass and smoothed them out, and they
looked everywhere, I suppose, for footprints or something
that you might have dropped when you fell. Then Sime
came back and they all went in and shut the door.”</p>

<p>Cheyne snorted angrily.</p>

<p>“It didn’t occur to you, I suppose, to make any effort
to help me or even find out if I was alive or dead? You
weren’t going to have any trouble, even if you did become
an accessory after the fact?”</p>

<p>“I’m coming to that, Mr. Cheyne. All in good time,
sir.” Speedwell rubbed his hands unctuously. “You will
understand that as long as the garden was occupied I
couldn’t come out from behind the bush. But directly the
coast was clear I got out of the garden and turned along
the lane where they had carried you. I wondered where
they could have hidden you, and I started searching. I
remembered what Sime had said about the ladder, so
I went to the half-built house and had a look around, but I
couldn’t find you in it. Then I saw you lying back of the
road fence, but just at that minute I heard footsteps, and
I stopped behind a pile of bricks till the party would pass.
But you called out and the lady stopped, and once again
I couldn’t interfere. I heard the arrangements about the
taxi, and when the lady went away to get it I slipped out
and hid where I could see it. In that way I got its number.
Next day I saw the driver and got out of him where he
had taken you, and I kept my eye on you and when you
got better trailed you to Miss Merrill’s. From other people
living in the flats I found out about her.” After a pause
he concluded: “And I think, gentlemen, that’s about all I
have to tell you.”</p>

<p>Inspector French slowly expelled a cloud of gray cigar
smoke from his mouth.</p>

<p>“Really, Speedwell, you have surpassed yourself,” he
murmured. “Your story, as I told you, sounds like a novel.
A pity though, that having gone so far you did not go a
little farther. You did not find out, for example, what
business this mysterious quartet were plotting?”</p>

<p>“I did not, Mr. French,” the man returned earnestly.
“I gathered that it was connected with ‘the tracing’ that
Dangle spoke of, and I imagined the tracing was what
they had been wanting from Mr. Cheyne, and evidently
had got, but I didn’t get a sight of it, and I have no idea
of their game.”</p>

<p>“And did you find out nothing that might be a help?
Where did those three men spend their time? What did
they do in the daytime?”</p>

<p>“Just what I told Mr. Cheyne, sir. I gave him perfectly
correct information in everything. Dangle is a town sharp
and helps run a gambling room in Knightsbridge. Sime is
another of the same—collects pigeons in the night clubs for
the others to pluck. Blessington, I got the hint, lived by
blackmail, but I’ve no proof of this.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. French, not that I know. Unless”—he
hesitated—“unless one thing. It may or may not be important;
I don’t know. It’s this: Dangle, during these last three
or four weeks, he’s been away nearly half the time from
London—on the Continent. I don’t know to what
country, but it must be France or Belgium or Holland, I should
think—or maybe Ireland—because he has crossed over
one night and crossed back the next. I know that because
of a remark I overheard him make to Sime in a tube lift
where I was standing just behind him. It was a Wednesday
and he said: ‘I’m crossing tonight, but I’ll be back
on Friday morning.’ ”</p>

<p>This seemed to be the sum total of Speedwell’s
knowledge, or at least all he would divulge, and he
presently departed, apparently cheered by French’s somewhat
cryptic declaration that he would not forget the part the
other had played in the affair. He perhaps would not have
been so pleased had he heard French’s subsequent
comments to Cheyne. “A dangerous man, Mr. Cheyne, for an
amateur to deal with, though he’s too much afraid of the
Yard to try any monkeying with me. I may tell you in
confidence that he was dismissed from the force on
suspicion of taking bribes to let a burglar get away—I
needn’t say the thing couldn’t be proved, or he would have
seen the inside of a convict prison, but there was no doubt
at all that he was guilty. Since that he has been caught
sailing rather close to the wind, but again he just
managed to keep himself safe. But the result is, he would do
anything to curry favor here, and indeed once or twice he
has been quite useful. I shouldn’t be at all surprised if he
had been blackmailing Blessington &amp; Co. in connection
with your attempted murder.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” Cheyne made a gesture of disgust. “The very
sight of the man makes me sick.” Then, his look of anxious
eagerness returning, he went on: “But, Inspector, his
story is all very well and interesting and all that, but I
don’t see that it helps us to find Miss Merrill, and that is
the only thing that matters.”</p>

<p>“The only thing to you, perhaps,” French returned,
“but not the only thing to me. This whole business looks
uncommonly like conspiracy for criminal purposes, and if
so, it automatically concerns the Yard.” He glanced at the
clock on the wall before his desk. “Let’s see now, it’s just
five o’clock. Before giving up for the day I should like to
have a look over Miss Merrill’s room to settle that little
question of the fur coat, and I should like you to come
with me. Shall we go now?”</p>

<p>Cheyne sprang to his feet eagerly. Action was what he
wanted, and his heart beat more rapidly at the prospect of
visiting a place where every object would remind him of
the girl he loved, and whom, in spite of himself, he feared
he had lost. Impatiently he waited while French put on his
hat and left word where he could be found in case of need.</p>

<p>Some fifteen minutes later the two men were ascending
the stairs of the house in Horne Terrace. The door of
No. 12 was shut, and to Cheyne’s knock there was no
response.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you needn’t expect Miss Merrill to have got
back,” French commented. “I had better open the door.”</p>

<p>He worked at it for a few moments, first with his bunch
of skeleton keys, then with a bent wire, until the bolt shot
back, and pushing open the door, they entered the room.</p>

<p>It was just as Cheyne had last seen it except that the
kettle and tea equipage had been tidied away. French
stood in the middle of the floor, glancing keenly round
on the contents. Then he moved to the other door.</p>

<p>“This her bedroom?” he inquired, as he pushed it open
and looked in.</p>

<p>As Cheyne followed him into the tiny apartment, he felt
as a devout Mohammedan might, who through stress of
circumstances entered fully shod into one of the holy
places of his religion. It seemed nothing short of profanation
for himself and this commonplace inspector of police
to intrude into a place so hallowed by association with
Her. In a kind of reverent awe he looked about him. There
was the bed in which She slept, the table at which She
dressed, the wardrobe in which Her dresses hung, and
there—what were those? He stood, stricken motionless by
surprise, staring at a tiny pair of rather high-heeled brown
shoes which were lying on their sides on the floor in front
of a chair.</p>

<p>French noted his expression.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he queried, following the direction of the
other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Her shoes!” Cheyne said in a tone of wonder, as he
might have said: “Her diamond coronet.”</p>

<p>French frowned.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s wonderful about that?” he asked with the
nearest approach to sharpness in his tone that Cheyne had
yet heard.</p>

<p>“Her shoes,” Cheyne repeated. “Her shoes that she wore
last night.”</p>

<p>It was now French’s turn to look interested.</p>

<p>“Sure of that?” he asked, picking up the shoes.</p>

<p>“Certain. I saw them on her in the train to Wembley.
Unless she has two absolutely identical pairs, she was
wearing those.”</p>

<p>French had been turning the shoes over in his hand.</p>

<p>“You said you saw a mark of where someone had
slipped on the bank behind the wall you threw the tracing
over,” he went on. “You might describe that mark.”</p>

<p>“It was just a kind of scrape on the sloping ground, with
the footprint below it. Her foot had evidently slipped
down till it came to a firmer place.”</p>

<p>“Right foot or left?”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“And which way was the toe pointing: towards the
bank or parallel with it?”</p>

<p>“Parallel. She had evidently climbed up diagonally.”</p>

<p>“Quite so. Now another question. If you were standing
in the field looking towards the bank, did she climb
towards the right hand or the left?”</p>

<p>“The left.”</p>

<p>“And the soil where the mark was; you might describe
that.”</p>

<p>“It was rather light in color, a yellowish brown. It was
clayey, and the print showed clearly, as it would in stiff
putty.”</p>

<p>French nodded.</p>

<p>“Then, Mr. Cheyne, if all your data are right, and if the
footprint was made by Miss Merrill when she was wearing
these shoes, I should expect to find a mark of yellowish
clay on the outside of the right shoe. Isn’t that correct?”</p>

<p>Cheyne thought for a moment, then signified his assent.</p>

<p>“I turn up this shoe,” French continued, suiting the
action to the word, “and I find here the very mark I was
expecting. See for yourself. I think we may take it then,
not only that Miss Merrill made the mark on the bank,
and of course made it last night, but also that she was
wearing these shoes when she made it. And that would
coincide with your observation.”</p>

<p>“But,” cried Cheyne, “I don’t understand. How did the
shoes get here? Miss Merrill wasn’t here since we left to
go to Wembley.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s what Dangle said. I don’t mean of course
that I believe Dangle. Everything else he’s said to me has
turned out to be a lie. But in this case the circumstances
seem to prove this story. If he didn’t see Miss Merrill
how did he know of her getting over the wall for the
tracing? And if he didn’t capture her then why did she not
return here? Or rather, suppose she did return, why should
she go away again without leaving a note or sending me a
message?”</p>

<p>French shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he answered. “I merely asked the
question and your answer certainly seems sound. But now let
us look about the coat.” He opened the wardrobe door.
“Is the cloth coat she was wearing last night here?”</p>

<p>A glance showed Cheyne the brown cloth, fur-trimmed
coat Joan had worn on the previous evening.</p>

<p>“And you will see further,” went on French when he
had been satisfied on this point, “that there is no coat here
of musquash fur. You say she had one?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have seen her wearing it several times.”</p>

<p>“Then I think Mrs. Sproule saw her wearing it today.
We may take it, I think, either that she returned here last
night and changed her clothes, or else that someone
brought in her coat and shoes, left them here and took
out her others.”</p>

<p>“The latter, I should think,” Cheyne declared.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t think she would come here of her own
free will and leave again without sending me some
message.”</p>

<p>French did not reply. He had rather taken the view that
if the girl was the prisoner of the gang the garments would
not have been changed, and the more he thought over it
the more probable this seemed. Rather he was inclined to
believe that she had reached her rooms after the episode at
Earlswood, possibly even with the tracing; that she had
been followed there and by some trick induced to leave
again, when in all probability she had been kidnaped
and the tracing recovered by the gang. But he felt there
was no use in discussing this theory with Cheyne, whose
anxiety as to the girl’s welfare had rendered his critical
faculty almost useless. He turned back to the young man.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that that shoe of Miss Merrill’s made
the mark you saw,” he observed. “At the same time I
want definite evidence. It won’t take very long to run out
to Wembley and try. Let us go now, and that will finish us
for tonight.”</p>

<p>They took a taxi and were soon at the place in question.
The print was not so clear as when Cheyne had seen it
first, but in spite of this French had no difficulty in
satisfying himself. The shoe fitted it exactly.</p>

<p>That night after supper, as French stretched himself in
his easy-chair, he decided he would have a preliminary
look at the tracing. He recognized that the mere fact that
it had been handed to Cheyne by Dangle involved the
probability that it was not the genuine document but a
faked copy. At the same time he was bound to make what
he could of it, and it was with very keen interest he
unfolded and began to study it.</p>

<p>It was neatly drawn, though evidently not by a professional
draughtsman. The lettering of the words, “England
expects every man to do his duty” was amateurish. He
wondered what the phrase could mean. It did not seem to
ring quite true. In his mind the words ran “England
expects that every man this day will do his duty,” but he
rather thought this was the version in the song, and if so,
the wording might have been altered from the original
for metrical reasons. He determined to look up the quotation
on the first opportunity. On the other hand it might
have been condensed into eight words in order to fit round
the sheet. It was spaced in a large circle among the smaller
circles like the figures of a clock. It conveyed to him no
idea whatever, except the obvious suggestion of Nelson.
Could Nelson, he wondered, or Trafalgar, be the key word
in some form of cipher?</p>

<p>As he studied the sheet he noted some points which
Cheyne appeared to have missed, or which at all events
he had not mentioned. While the circles were spaced
without any apparent plan—absolutely irregularly, it seemed
to French—there was some evidence of arrangement in
their contents. Those nearer the edges of the tracing
contained letters, while those more centrally situated bore
numbers. There was no hard and fast line between the
two, as letters and numbers appeared, so to speak, to
overlap each other’s territory, but broadly speaking the
arrangement held. He noticed also a few circles which
contained neither numbers nor letters, but instead tiny
irregular lines. There were only some half dozen of these,
but all of them so far as he could see occurred on the
neutral territory between the number zone and the letter
zone. These irregular lines represented nothing that he
could imagine, and no two appeared of the same shape.</p>

<p>That the document was a cipher he could not but
conclude, and in vain he puzzled over it until long past his
usual bedtime. Finally, locking it away in his desk, he
decided that when he had completed the obvious
investigations which still remained, he would have another go at
it, working through all the possibilities that occurred to
him systematically and thoroughly.</p>

<p>But before French had another opportunity to examine
it, further news had come in which had led him a dance
of several hundred miles, and left him hot on the track of
the conspirators.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch15">

<h2>Chapter XV. <br/> The Torn Hotel Bill</h2>

<p>On reaching the Yard next morning Inspector French
began his day by compiling a list of the various points on
which obvious investigations still remained to be made.
He had already determined that these should be carried
through with the greatest possible dispatch, leaving a
general consideration of the case over until their results should
be available.</p>

<p>The immediate questions were, of course: Was Joan
Merrill alive? And if so, where was she? These must be
solved as soon as possible. The further matters relating to
the hiding-place and aims of the gang could wait. It was,
however, likely enough that if French could find Joan, he
would have at least gone a long way towards solving her
captors’ secret.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most promising of all the lines of inquiry open
to him were the detailed searches of Blessington’s and
Sime’s houses, and he decided he would begin with these.
Accordingly, having called Sergeant Carter and a couple
more men, he went out to Earlswood and set to work.</p>

<p>French was extraordinarily thorough. Nothing in that
house, from the water cistern space in the roof to the floors
of the pantries and the tool shed in the yard—nothing
escaped observation. The furniture was examined, particularly
the writing desk and the old escritoire, the carpets
were lifted and the floors tested, the walls were minutely
inspected for secret receptacles, the pages of the books were
turned over, the clothes—of which a respectable wardrobe
remained—were gone through, with special attention to
the pockets. Nothing was taken for granted: everything
was examined. Even the outside of the house and the soil
of the garden were looked at, and at the end, some four
hours after they had begun, French had to admit that his
gains were practically nil.</p>

<p>The reservation was in respect of four objects, from one
or more of which he might conceivably extract some
information, though he was far from hopeful. The first was the
top sheet of Blessington’s writing pad. French, following
his usual custom, had examined it through a mirror, but
so completely covered was it with inkstains that he was
unable to decipher even a single word. However, on chance
he tore it off and put it in his pocket, in the hope that
a future more detailed examination might reveal something
of interest.</p>

<p>The second object was a scrap of crumpled paper which
he found in the right-hand upper pocket of one of Dangle’s
waistcoats. It looked as if it had been crushed to the
bottom of the pocket by some other article—such as an
engagement book—being thrust down on the top of it.
When the pockets had been cleared—as all had been—this
small piece of paper had evidently been overlooked.</p>

<p>French straightened it out. It was the bottom portion of
what was clearly a bill, apparently a French hotel bill. On
the back was a note written in pencil, and as French read
it, the thought passed through his mind that he could not
have imagined any more unexpected or puzzling contents.
It was in the form of a memorandum and read:</p>

<table class="display">
<tbody><tr><td>. . . . . . ins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>. . . . ators.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Peaches—3 doz. tins.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Safety Matches—6 doz. boxes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Galsworthy—The Forsyte Saga.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pencils and Fountain Pen Ink.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sou’wester.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The paper was torn across the first two items, so that
only part of the words were legible. What so heterogeneous
a collection could possibly refer to French could not
imagine, but he put the fragment in his pocket with the
blotting paper for future study.</p>

<p>The other two objects were photographs, and from the
descriptions he had received from Cheyne he felt satisfied
that one was of Blessington and the other of Dangle. These
were of no help in themselves, but might later prove useful
for identification purposes.</p>

<p>The search of Earlswood complete, French gave his men
an hour for lunch, and then started a similar investigation
of Sime’s house. He was just as painstaking and thorough
here, but this time he had no luck at all. Though Sime
had not so carefully destroyed papers and correspondence,
he could not find a single thing which seemed to offer help.</p>

<p>Sime’s house being so much smaller than Blessington’s,
the search was finished in little over an hour. On its
completion French sent two of his men back to the Yard, while
with Sergeant Carter he drove to Horne Terrace. There he
examined Joan Merrill’s rooms, again without result.</p>

<p>The work ended about four, and then he and Carter
began another job, quite as detailed and a good deal more
wearisome than the others. He had determined to question
individually every other person living in the house—that
is, the inhabitants of no less than nine flats—in the hope
that some one of them might have seen or heard Joan
returning to her rooms on the night of her disappearance.
In a way the point was not of supreme importance, but
experience had taught French the danger of neglecting <em>any</em>
clue, no matter how unpromising, and he had long since
made it a principle to follow up every opening which
offered.</p>

<p>For over two hours he worked, and at last, as he was
beginning to accept defeat, he obtained just the
information he required.</p>

<p>It appeared that about a quarter past eleven on the
night in question, the fifteen-year-old daughter of a widow
living on the third floor was returning home from some
small jollification when she saw, just as she approached the
door, three persons come out. Two were men, one tall, well
built and clean-shaven, the other short and stout, with a
fair toothbrush mustache. The third person was Miss
Merrill. A street lamp had shone directly on their faces as
they emerged, and the girl had noticed that the men wore
serious expressions and that Miss Merrill looked pale and
anxious, as if all three were sharers in some bad news.
They crossed the sidewalk to a waiting motor. Miss Merrill
and the taller man got inside, the second man driving.
During the time the girl saw them, none of them spoke.
She remembered the car. It was a yellow one with a coach
body, and looked a private vehicle. Yes, she recognized
the photograph the Inspector showed her—Blessington’s.
It was that of the driver of the car.</p>

<p>It did not seem worth while to French to try to trace
the car, as he fancied he knew where it had gone. From
Horne Terrace to Sime’s house in Colton Street was about
a ten minute run. Therefore if it left the former about
11:15, it should reach the latter a minute or two before
the half-hour. This worked in with the time at which the
invalid lady, Mrs. Sproule, had heard the motor stop in
the street, and to French it seemed clear that Miss Merrill
had been taken direct to Sime’s, and kept there until
1:45 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>
on the following day. What arguments or threats the
pair had used to get her to accompany them French could
not tell, but he shrewdly suspected that they had played
the same trick on her as on Cheyne. In all probability they
had told her that Cheyne had met with an accident and
was conscious and asking for her. Once in the cab it would
have been child’s play for a powerful man like Sime to
have chloroformed her, and having got her to the house,
they could easily have kept her helpless and semi-conscious
by means of drugs.</p>

<p>French returned on foot to the Yard, thinking over the
affair as he walked. It certainly had a sinister look. These
men were very much in earnest. They had not hesitated to
resort to murder in the case of Cheyne—it was through,
to them, an absolutely unforeseen accident that he
escaped—and French felt he would not give much for Joan
Merrill’s chances.</p>

<p>When he reached his office he found that a piece of
news had just come in. A constable who had been on
point duty at the intersection of South and Mitchem
Streets, near Waterloo Station, had noticed about 2 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> on the day of the disappearance of the gang, a yellow
motorcar pass close beside him and turn into Hackworth’s
garage, a small establishment in the latter street. Though
he had not observed the vehicle with more than the
ordinary attention such a man will give to the passing traffic,
his recollection both of the car and driver led him to the
belief that they were those referred to in the Yard circular.
The constable was waiting to see French, and made his
report with diffidence, saying that though he thought he
was right, he might easily be mistaken.</p>

<p>“Quite right to let me know anyhow, Wilson,” French
said heartily. “If you’ve seen Blessington’s car it may give
us a valuable clue, and if you’re mistaken, there’s no harm
done. We’ve nothing to lose by following it up.” He
glanced at his watch. “It’s past my dinner hour, but I’ll
take a taxi and go round to this garage on my way home.
You’d better come along.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the two men reached Hackworth’s
establishment, and pushing open the door of the tiny
office, asked if the manager was about.</p>

<p>“I’m John Hackworth. Yes, sir?” said a stout man in
shabby gray tweeds. “Want a car?”</p>

<p>“I want a word with you, Mr. Hackworth,” said French
pleasantly. “Just a small matter of private business.”</p>

<p>Hackworth nodded, and indicated a farther door.</p>

<p>“In here,” he invited, and when French and the
constable had taken the two chairs the room contained, he
briskly repeated: “Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>At this hint not to waste valuable time, French promptly
introduced himself and propounded his question. Mr.
Hackworth looked impressed.</p>

<p>“You don’t tell me that gent was a wrong ’un?” he said
anxiously, then another idea seeming to strike him, he
continued: “Of course it don’t matter to me in a way, for
I’ve got the car. I’ll tell you about it.”</p>

<p>French produced his photograph of Blessington.</p>

<p>“Tell me first if that’s the man,” he suggested.</p>

<p>Mr. Hackworth pushed the card up to the electric bulb.
“It’s him,” he declared. “It’s him and no mistake. He
walked in here yesterday—no, the day before—about
eleven and asked to see the boss. ‘I’ve got a car,’ he said
when I went forward, ‘and there’s something wrong with
the engine. Sometimes it goes all right and sometimes it
doesn’t. Maybe,’ he said, ‘you’ll start it up and it’ll run a
mile or two well enough, then it begins to miss, and the
speed drops perhaps to eight or ten miles. I don’t know
what’s wrong.’</p>

<p>“ ‘What about your petrol feed?’ I said. ‘Sounds like
your carburetor, or maybe your strainer or one of your
pipes choked.’</p>

<p>“ ‘I thought it might be that,’ he said, ‘but I couldn’t
find anything wrong. However, I want you to look over it,
that is, if you can lend me a car while you’re doing it.’</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I needn’t go into all the details, and to make
a long story short, I agreed to overhaul the car and to
lend him an old Napier while I was at it. He went away,
and same day about two or before it he came back with
his car, a yellow Armstrong Siddeley. It seemed to be all
right then, but he said that that was just the trouble—it
might be all right now and it would be all wrong within
a minute’s time. So I gave him the Napier—it was a done
machine, worth very little, but would go all right, you
understand. He asked me how long I would take, and I
said I’d have it for him next day, that was yesterday. He
had three or four suitcases with him and he transferred
these across. Then he got into the Napier and drove away,
and that was the last I saw of him.”</p>

<p>“And what was wrong with his own car?”</p>

<p>“There, sir, you have me beat. Nothing! Or nothing
anyhow that I could find.”</p>

<p>“Was the Napier a four-seater?”</p>

<p>“Five. Three behind and two in front.”</p>

<p>“A coach body?”</p>

<p>“No, but with a good canvas cover, and he put it up,
too, before starting.”</p>

<p>“Raining?”</p>

<p>“Neither raining nor like rain: nor no wind neither.”</p>

<p>“How long was he here altogether?”</p>

<p>“Not more than five or six minutes. He left just as soon
as he could change the cars.”</p>

<p>French, having put a few more questions, got the
proprietor to write out a detailed description of the Napier.
Next, he begged the use of the garage telephone and
repeated the description to the Yard, asking that it should
be circulated among the force without delay. Finally he
thanked the stout Mr. Hackworth for his help, and with
Constable Wilson left the establishment.</p>

<p>“Now, Wilson,” he said, “you’ve done a good day’s
work. I’m pleased with you. You may get along home, and
if I want anything more I’ll let you know in the morning.”</p>

<p>But though it was so late, French did not follow his
subordinate’s example. Instead he stood on the sidewalk
outside the garage, thinking hard.</p>

<p>As to the nature of the defect in the engine of the yellow
car he had no doubt. What was wrong with it was just
what Hackworth had said was wrong with it—nothing
whatever. French could see that the whole episode was
simply a plan on Blessington’s part to change the car and
thus cover up his traces. The yellow Armstrong-Siddeley
was known to be his by many persons, and Blessington
wanted one which, as he would believe, could not be
traced. He would have seen from the papers that Cheyne
had escaped the fate prepared for him, and he would
certainly suspect that the outraged young man would put his
knowledge at the disposal of the police. Therefore the
yellow car was a danger and another must be procured in
its place. The trick was obvious, and French had heard of
something like it before.</p>

<p>But though the main part of the scheme was clear to
French, the details were not. From the statement of Mrs.
Sproule, the invalid of Colton Street, the yellow car had
left Sime’s house at about 1:45. According to this
Hackworth it had reached the garage at a minute or so
before two. Now, from Colton Street to the garage was a
ten or twelve minutes’ drive, therefore Blessington must
have gone practically direct. Moreover, when he left
Colton Street Joan Merrill and the other members of the
gang were in the car, but when he reached the garage he
was alone. Where had the others dismounted?</p>

<p>Another question suggested itself to French, and he
thought that if he could answer it he would probably be
able to answer the first as well. Why did Blessington select
this particular garage? He did not know this Hackworth—the
man had said he had never seen Blessington before.
Why then this particular establishment rather than one of
the scores nearer Sime’s dwelling?</p>

<p>For some minutes French puzzled over this point, and
then a probable explanation struck him. There, just a
hundred yards or more away, was a place admirably suited
for dropping his passengers and picking them up again—Waterloo
Station. What more natural for Blessington than
to pull up at the departure side with the yellow
Armstrong-Siddeley and set them down? What more commonplace
for him than to pick them up at the arrival side with the
black Napier? While he was changing the cars, they could
enter, mingle with the crowds of passengers, work their
way across the station and be waiting for him as if they
had just arrived by train.</p>

<p>Late as it was, French returned to the Yard and put a
good man on to make inquiries at Waterloo in the hope of
proving his theory. Then, tired and very hungry, he went
home.</p>

<p>But when he had finished supper and, ensconced in his
armchair with a cigar, had looked through the evening
paper, interest in the case reasserted itself, and he
determined that he would have a look at the scrap of paper
which he had found in the pocket of one of Dangle’s
waistcoats.</p>

<p>As has been said, it was a list or memorandum of certain
articles, written on the back of part of an old hotel bill.
French reread the items with something as nearly
approaching bewilderment as a staid inspector of the Yard
can properly admit. Peaches, safety matches, the Forsyte
Saga, pencil, fountain pen ink, and a sou’wester! What in
the name of goodness could anyone want with such a
heterogeneous collection? And the quantities! Three dozen
tins of peaches, and six dozen boxes of matches! Enough
to do a small expeditionary force, French thought
whimsically, though he did not see an expeditionary force
requiring the works of John Galsworthy, ink, and pencils.</p>

<p>And yet was this idea so absurd? Did not these articles,
in point of fact, suggest an expedition? Peaches, matches,
pencils, and ink—all these articles were commonplace and
universally obtainable. Did the fact that a quantity were
required not mean that Dangle or his friends were to be
cut off for some considerable time from the ordinary
sources of supply? It certainly looked like it. And as he
thought over the other articles, he saw that they too were
not inconsistent with the same idea. The Forsyte Saga was
distinguished from most novels in a peculiar and indeed a
suggestive manner. It consisted of a number of novels, each
full length or more than full length, but the point of
interest was that the entire collection was published on thin
paper in this one volume. Where could one get a greater
mass of reading matter in a smaller bulk: in other words,
where could one find a more suitable work of fiction to
carry with one on an expedition?</p>

<p>The sou’wester also fitted from this point of view into
the scheme of things, but it added a distinctive suggestion
all its own: that of the sea. French’s thoughts turned
towards a voyage. But it could not be an ordinary voyage
in a well-appointed liner, where peaches and matches and
novels would be as plentiful as in the heart of London.
Nor did it seem likely that it could be a trip in the <i>Enid</i>.
Such a craft could not remain out of touch with land for
so long a period as these stores seemed to postulate. French
could not think of anything that seemed exactly to meet
the case, though he registered the idea of an expedition as
one to be kept in view.</p>

<p>Leaving the point for the time being, he turned over the
paper and began to examine its other side.</p>

<p>It formed the middle portion of an old hotel bill, the top
and bottom having been torn off. The items indicated a
stay of one night only being merely for bed and breakfast.
The name of the hotel had been torn off with the bill
head, and also all but a few letters of the green rubber
receipt stamp at the bottom. French felt that if he could
only ascertain the identity of the hotel it might afford him
a valuable clue, and he settled down to study it in as close
detail as possible.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A torn scrap of paper, showing part of a bill for “1 chambre” and “1 petit déjeuner”, totaling to 28 50. The ends of a few other words are visible at the edges of the paper." src="images/scrap.png" id="img_images_scrap.png"/>
</figure>

<p>He recalled two statements that Speedwell had made
about Dangle. First, the melancholy detective had said
that commencing about a fortnight after the acquisition by
the gang of Price’s letter and the tracing, Dangle had
begun paying frequent visits to the Continent or Ireland,
and secondly, that in a tube lift he had overheard Dangle
say that he was crossing on a given night, but would be
back the next. French thought he might take it for granted
that this bill had been incurred on one of these trips. He
wondered if Dangle had always visited the same place, as,
if so, the bill would refer to an hotel near enough to
England to be visited in one day. Of none of this was
there any evidence, but French believed that it was
sufficiently probable to be taken as a working hypothesis.
If it led nowhere, he could try something else.</p>

<p>Assuming then that one could cross to the place in one
night and return the next, it was obvious that it must be
comparatively close to England, and, the language on the
bill being French, it must be in France or Belgium. He
took an atlas and a Continental Bradshaw, and began to
look out the area over which this condition obtained. Soon
he saw that while the whole of Belgium and the
northwest of France, bounded by a rough line drawn through
Chalons, Nancy, Dijon, Angoulême, Chartres, and Brest,
were within the <em>possible</em> limit, giving a reasonable time in
which to transact business, it was more than likely the
place did not lie east of Brussels and Paris.</p>

<p>He turned back to the torn bill. Could he learn nothing
from it?</p>

<p>First, as to the charges. With the franc standing at
eighty, twenty four francs seemed plenty for a single room,
though it was by no means exorbitant. It and the 4.50 fr.
for <i>petit déjeuner</i> suggested a fairly good hotel—probably
what might be termed good second-class—not one of the
great hotels de luxe like the Savoy in London or the
Crillon or Claridge’s in Paris, but one that ordinary people
patronized, and which would be well known in its own
town.</p>

<p>Of all the information available, the most promising line
of research seemed that of the rubber stamp, and to that
French now turned his attention. The three lines read:</p>

<table class="display">
<tbody><tr><td>. . . uit</td></tr>
<tr><td>. . . lon,</td></tr>
<tr><td>. . . S.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>French thought he had something that might help here.
He rose, crossed the room, and after searching in his letter
file, produced three or four papers. These were hotel bills
he had incurred in France and Switzerland when he
visited those countries in search of the murderer of Charles
Gething of the firm of Duke &amp; Peabody, and he had
brought them home with him in the hope that some day
he might return as a holiday-maker to these same hotels.
Now perhaps they would be of use in another way.</p>

<p>He spread them out and examined their receipt stamps.
From their analogy the . . . uit on his fragment obviously
stood for the words “Pour acquit,” anglice: “paid.” The
middle line ending in . . . lon was unquestionably the
name of the hotel, and the third, ending in S, that of its
town. And here again was a suggestion as to the size of
the establishment. A street was not included in the
address. It must therefore be well known in its town.</p>

<p>It seemed to him moreover that this fact also conveyed
a suggestion as to the size of the town. If the latter were
Paris or Brussels—as he had thought not unlikely as both
these names ended in s—a street address would almost
certainly have been given. The names of the hotel and
town alone pointed to a town of the same standing as the
hotel itself—a large town to have so important an hotel,
but not a capital city. In other words, there was a certain
probability the hotel was situated in a large town
comparatively near the English Channel, Paris and Brussels
being excepted.</p>

<p>As French sat pondering over the affair, he saw suddenly
that further information was obtainable from the fact that
the lettering on a rubber stamp is always done symmetrically.
Once more rising, he found a small piece of tracing
paper, and placing this over the mutilated receipt stamp,
he began to print in the missing letters of the first line.
His printing was not very good, but he did not mind that.
All he wanted was to get the spacing of the letters correct,
and to this end he took a lot of trouble. He searched
through the advertisements in several papers until he
found some type of the same kind as that of the . . . uit,
and by carefully measuring the other letters he at last
satisfied himself as to just where the P of Pour acquit
would stand. This, he hoped, would give him the number
of letters in the names of both the hotel and the town.
Drawing a line down at right angles to the t of acquit,
he found that the n of . . . lon projected slightly over a
quarter inch farther along, while the S of the town was
almost directly beneath. By drawing another line down
from the P of Pour, and measuring these same distances
from it, he found the lengths of the names of hotel and
town, and by further careful examination and spacing of
type, he reached definite conclusions. The name of the
hotel, including the word hotel, contained from eighteen
to twenty letters and that of the town six, more or less
according to whether letters like I or W predominated.</p>

<p>He was pleased with his progress. Starting from nothing
he had evolved the conception of an important hotel—the
something-lon, in a large town situated in France or
Belgium, and comparatively near the English Channel, the
name of the town consisting of five, six, or seven letters of
which the last one was S. Surely, he thought, such an
hotel would not be hard to find.</p>

<p>If he was correct as to the size of the town, it was one
which would be marked on a fairly small scale map, and
taking his atlas, he began to make a list of all those which
seemed to meet the case. He soon saw there were a
number—Calais, Amiens, Beauvais, Étaples, Arras, Soissons,
Troyes, Ypres, Bruges, Roulers, and Malines.</p>

<p>He had by this time become so excited over his quest that
in spite of the hour—it was long past his bedtime—he
telephoned to the Yard to send him Baedeker’s Guides to
Northern France and Belgium, and when these came he
began eagerly looking up the hotels in each of the towns
on his list. For a considerable time he worked on without
result, then suddenly he laughed from sheer delight.</p>

<p>He had reached Bruges, and there, third on the list,
was “Grand Hôtel du Sablon!” Moreover, this name
exactly filled the required space.</p>

<p>“Got it in one,” he chuckled, feeling immensely pleased
with himself.</p>

<p>But French, if sometimes an enthusiastic optimist and
again a down and out pessimist, was at all times thorough.
He did not stop at Bruges. He worked all the way through
the list, and it was not until he had satisfied himself that
no other hotel fulfilling the conditions existed in any of
the other towns, that he felt himself satisfied. It was true
there was an Hotel du Carillon in Malines, but this name
was obviously too short for the space.</p>

<p>As he went jubilantly to bed, the vision of a trip to the
historic city of Bruges bulked large in his imagination.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch16">

<h2>Chapter XVI. <br/> A Tale of Two Cities</h2>

<p>Next morning French had an interview with his chief at
the Yard at which he produced the torn hotel bill, and
having demonstrated the methods by which he had come
to identify it with the Grand Hôtel du Sablon in Bruges,
suggested that a visit there might be desirable. To his
secret relief Chief Inspector Mitchell took the same view,
and it was arranged that he should cross as soon as he
could get away.</p>

<p>On his return to his room he found Cheyne waiting for
him. The young man seemed to have aged by years since
his frenzied appeal to the Yard, and his anxious face and
distrait manner bore testimony to the mental stress
through which he was passing. Eagerly he inquired for
news.</p>

<p>“None so far, I’m sorry to say,” French answered,
“except that we have found that Miss Merrill did return to
her rooms that night,” and he told what he had learned of
Joan’s movements, as well as of his visit to Hackworth’s
garage, and of Blessington’s exchange of cars. But of
Bruges and the hotel bill he said nothing. Cheyne, he felt
sure, would have begged to be allowed to accompany him
to Belgium, and this he did not want. But in his kindly
way he talked sympathetically to the young man
reiterating his promise to let him know directly anything of
importance was learned.</p>

<p>Cheyne having reluctantly taken his leave, French
turned to routine business, which had got sadly behind
during the last few days. At this he worked all the
morning, but on his return from lunch he found that further
news had come in.</p>

<p>Sergeant Burnett, the man he had put on the Waterloo
Station job, was waiting for him, and reported success in
his mission. He had, he said, spent the whole of the day
from early morning at the station, and at last he had
obtained what he wanted. A taximan on a nearby stand
had been called to the footpath at the arrival side of the
station at about 2:00 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> He had drawn up behind an
old black car, which he had thought was a Napier. His own
fare, a lady, kept him waiting for a few seconds while she
took a somewhat leisurely farewell of the gentleman who
was seeing her off, and during this time he had idly
watched the vehicle in front. He had seen an invalid lady
in a sable colored fur coat being helped in. There was a
second lady with her, and a tall man. The three got in,
and the car moved off at the same time as his own.
Sergeant Burnett had questioned the man on the appearance
of the travelers, and was pretty certain that they were
Joan, Susan, and Sime. Dangle, so far as he could learn,
was not with them.</p>

<p>French felt the sudden thrill of the artist who has just
caught the elusive effect of light which he wanted, as he
reflected how sound had been his deduction. He had
considered it likely that these people would use Waterloo
Station to effect the change of cars, and now it seemed that
they had done so. Nothing like a bit of imagination, he
thought, as he good-naturedly complimented the sergeant
on his powers, and dismissed him.</p>

<p>Having too much to see to at the Yard to catch the
2:00 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> from Victoria for Ostend, he rang up and
engaged a berth on the Harwich-Zeebrugge boat, and that night
at 8:40 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> he left Liverpool Street for Belgium.</p>

<p>Apart from his actual business, he was looking forward
with considerable keenness to the trip. Foreign travel had
become perhaps his greatest pleasure, and he had never yet
been in Belgium. Moreover he had always heard Bruges
mentioned as the paradise of artists, and in a rather
shamefaced way he admitted an interest in and appreciation of
art. He had determined that if at all possible he would
snatch enough time to see at least the more interesting
parts of the old town.</p>

<p>They left the Parkeston Quay at 10:30, and by 6 next
morning French was on deck. He was anxious to miss no
possible sight of the approach of Zeebrugge. He had read
with a thrilled and breathless interest the story of what
was perhaps the greatest naval exploit of all time—as,
indeed, who has not?—and as the long, low line of the
famous mole loomed up rather starboard of straight ahead,
his heart beat faster and a lump came in his throat. There,
away to the right, round the curve of the long pier, must
have been where <i>Vindictive</i> boarded, where in an inferno
of fire her crew reached with their scaling ladders the top
of the great sea wall, and climbing down on the inside,
joined a hand-to-hand fight with the German defenders.
And here, at the left hand end of the huge semicircle, was
the lighthouse, which he was now rounding as <i>Thetis</i>, <i>Intrepid</i>,
and <i>Iphigenia</i> rounded it on that historic night.
He tried to picture the scene. The screen of smoke to sea,
which baffled the searchlights of the defenders and from
which mysterious and unexpected craft emerged at
intervals, the flashing lights as guns were fired and shells burst
over the mole, the sea, and the low-lying sand dunes of
the coast behind. The din of hell in the air, fire, smoke,
explosion, and death—and those three ships passing
on; <i>Thetis</i> a wreck, struck and fiercely burning, forced aside
by the destruction of her gear, but lighting her fellows
straight to their goal—the mouth of the canal which led to
the submarine base at Bruges. French crossed the deck and
gazed at the spot with its swing bridge and stone side
walls, as he thought how, had the desperate venture failed,
history might have been changed and at that touch and
go period of the war the Central Powers might have
triumphed. It was with renewed pride and wonder in the
men who conceived and carried out the wonderful
enterprise that he crossed back over the deck and set himself
to the business of landing.</p>

<p>A short run past the sandhills at the coast and across
the flat Belgian fields brought the spires of Bruges into
view, and slowly rounding a sharp curve through the
gardens of the houses in the suburbs, they joined the main line
from Ostend, and a few minutes later entered the station.
Emerging on to the wide boulevard in front, French’s
eyes fell on a bus bearing the legend “Grand Hôtel du
Sablon,” and getting in, he was driven across the
boulevard and a short way up a long, rather narrow and
winding street, between houses some of which seemed to have
stood unaltered—and doubtless had—for six hundred
years, when Bruges, three times its present size, was the
chief trading city of the Hanseatic League. As he turned
into the hotel, chimes rang out—from the famous belfry,
the porter told him—tinkling, high-pitched bells and
silvery, if a trifle thin in the clear morning air.</p>

<p>He called for some breakfast, and as he was consuming
it the anticipated delights of sight-seeing receded, and
interest in the movements of James Dangle became once
more paramount. He was proud of his solution of the
problem of the torn hotel bill, and not for a moment had
a doubt of the correctness of that solution entered his
head.</p>

<p>It came upon him therefore as a devastating shock when
the courteous manager of the hotel, with whom he had
asked an interview, assured him not only that no such
person as the original of the photograph he had presented
had ever visited his establishment, but that the fragment
of the bill was not his.</p>

<p>To French it seemed as if the bottom had fallen out of
his world. He had been so sure of his ground; all his
reasoning about the stamp, the size of the hotel and town and
lengths of their names had seemed so convincing and
unassailable. And the names Grand Hôtel du Sablon and
Bruges had worked in so well! More important still, no
other hotel seemed to fill the bill. French felt cast down to
the lowest depths of despair, and for a time he could only
stare speechlessly at the manager.</p>

<p>At last he smiled rather ruefully.</p>

<p>“That’s rather a blow,” he confessed. “I was pretty sure
of my ground. Indeed, so sure was I, that if I might
without offense, I should like to ask you again if there is no
possibility that the man might have been here, say, during
your absence.”</p>

<p>The manager was sympathetic. He brought French a
sample of his bill, stamped with his rubber receipt stamp,
and French saw at once their dissimilarity with those he
had been studying. Moreover, the manager assured him
that neither had been altered for several years.</p>

<p>So he was no further on! French lit a cigar, and retiring
to a deserted corner of the salon, sat down to think the
thing out.</p>

<p>What was he to do next? Was he to return to London by
the next boat, giving up the search and admitting defeat,
or was there any possible alternative? He set his teeth as he
swore great oaths that nothing short of the direct need
would lead him to abandon his efforts until he had found
the hotel, and learned Dangle’s secret.</p>

<p>But heroics were all very well: what, in point of fact
was he to do? He sat considering the problem for an hour,
and at the end of that time he had decided to go to
Brussels, borrow or buy a Belgian hotel guide, and go through
it page by page until he found what he wanted. If none
of the hotels given suited, he would go on to Paris and try
a similar experiment.</p>

<p>This decision he reached only after long consideration,
not because it was not obvious—it had instantly occurred
to him—but because he was convinced that the methods
he had already tried had completely covered the ground.
He had proved that there was no hotel whose name ended
in . . . lon in a fair-sized town whose name ended
in . . . s in all the district in question, other than the
Grand Hôtel du Sablon at Bruges. There still remained,
however, the chance that it might be a southern French or
Swiss hotel, and he saw that he would have to make sure
of this before returning to London.</p>

<p>Still buried in thought, he walked slowly back to the
station to look up trains to Brussels. The fact that he was
in the most interesting town in Belgium no longer stirred
his pulse. His disappointment and anxiety about his case
drove all irrelevant matters from his mind, and he felt
that all he wanted now was to be at work again to
retrieve his error.</p>

<p>He reached the station, and began searching the huge
timetable boards for the train he wanted. He was
interested to notice that the tables were published in two
languages, French and what he thought at first was Dutch,
but concluded later must be Flemish. Idly he compared
the different spelling of the names of the towns. Brugge
and Bruges, Gent and Gand, Brussel and Bruxelles,
Oostende and Ostende, and then suddenly he came up
as it were all standing, and a sudden wave of excitement
passed over him as he stood regarding another pair of
names. Antwerpen and Anvers! Anvers! A six lettered
town ending in s! He cursed himself for his stupidity. He
had always thought of the place as Antwerp, but he ought
to have known its French name. Anvers! Once more he
was alert and full of eager optimism. Had he got it at
last?</p>

<p>He passed through on to the platform, and making for
a door headed “Chef de Gare,” asked for the stationmaster.
There, after a moment’s delay, he was shown into the
presence of an imposing individual in gold lace, who,
however, was not too important to listen to him carefully and
reply courteously in somewhat halting English. Monsieur
wished to know if there was an hotel whose name ended
in . . . lon in Antwerp? He could not recall one off hand,
but he would look up the advertisements in his guides and
tourist programs. Ah, what was this? The Grand Hôtel du
Carillon. Was that what monsieur required?</p>

<p>A name of twenty letters—which would exactly fill the
space on the receipt stamp! It certainly was what
monsieur required! The very idea raised monsieur to an exalted
pitch of delighted enthusiasm. The stationmaster was
gratified at the reception of his information.</p>

<p>“I haf been at the ’otel myself,” he volunteered. “It is
small, but vair’ goot. It is in the Place Verte, near to the
Cathedral. Does monsieur know Antwerp?”</p>

<p>Monsieur did not, but he expressed the pleasure it would
give him to make its acquaintance, and thanking the polite
official he returned to the timetables to look up the trains
thither.</p>

<p>His most direct way, it appeared, was through Ghent
and Termonde, but on working out the services he found
he could get quicker trains via Brussels. He therefore
booked by that route, and at 11:51 he climbed into a great
through express from Ostend to Brussels, Aix-la-Chapelle,
Strasbourg, and, it seemed to him, the whole of the rest
of Europe. An hour and a half’s run brought him into
Brussels-Nord, and from there he wandered out into the
Place Rogier for lunch. Then returning to the station he
took an express for Antwerp, arriving in the central
terminus of that city a few minutes after three o’clock.</p>

<p>He had bought a map of Antwerp at a bookstall in
Brussels, from which he had learned that the Place Verte
was nearly a mile away in the direction of the river. His
traveling impedimenta consisting of a handbag only, he
determined to walk, and emerging from the great marble
hall of the station, he passed down the busy Avenue de
Keyser, and along the Place de Meir into the older part of
the town. As he walked he was immensely impressed by
the fine wide streets, the ornate buildings, and the
excellence of the shops. Everywhere were evidences of wealth
and prosperity, and as he turned into the Place Verte, and
looked across at the huge bulk of the Cathedral with its
soaring spire, he felt that here was an artistic treasure of
which any city might well be proud.</p>

<p>The Grand Hôtel du Carillon was an old, quaint
looking building looking out over the Place Verte. French,
entering, called for a bock in the restaurant, and after
he had finished, asked to see the manager. A moment later
a small, stout man with a humorous eye appeared, bowed
low, and said that he was M. Marquet, the proprietor.</p>

<p>“A word with you in private, M. Marquet,” French
requested, when they had exchanged confidences on the
weather. “Won’t you take something with me?”</p>

<p>The proprietor signified his willingness in excellent
English, and when further drinks had been brought, and
French had satisfied himself that they were alone, he went
on:</p>

<p>“I am a detective officer from the London police, and I
am trying to trace an Englishman called Dangle. I have
reason to suppose he stayed at this hotel recently. There is
his photograph. Can you help me at all?”</p>

<p>At the name Dangle, M. Marquet had nodded, and
when he saw the photograph he beamed and his whole
body became affirmation personified. But certainly, he
knew M. Dangle. For several weeks—he could not say
how many, but he could ascertain from his records—for
several weeks M. Dangle had been his guest at intervals.
Sometimes he had stayed one night, sometimes two,
sometimes three. Yes, he was usually alone, but not always.
On three or four occasions he had been accompanied by
another gentleman—a tall, well-built, clean-shaven man,
and once a third man had come, a short man with a fair
mustache. Yes, that was the photograph of the short man,
M.—? Yes; Blessington. The other man’s name he could
not remember, but it would appear in the register: Sile,
Site—something like that. Yes, Sime: that was it. No, he
was afraid he knew nothing about these gentlemen or
their business, but he would be glad to do everything in
his power to assist monsieur.</p>

<p>French, his enthusiasm and delight remaining at fever
heat, was suitably grateful. He wished just to ask M. Marquet
a few more questions. He would like to know the last
occasion on which M. Dangle had stayed.</p>

<p>“Why,” M. Marquet exclaimed, “he just left yesterday.
He came here, let me see, on Tuesday night quite late,
indeed it was nearly one on Wednesday morning when he
arrived. He came, he said, off the English boat train which
arrives here about midnight. He stayed here two days—till
yesterday, Thursday. He left yesterday shortly after
déjeuner.”</p>

<p>“He was alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur. This time he was alone.”</p>

<p>French, metaphorically speaking, hugged himself on
hearing this news. Through his brilliant work with the
torn bill, he had added one more fine achievement to the
long list of his successes. He could not but believe that the
most doubtful and difficult step of the investigation had
now been accomplished. With a trail only twenty four
hours old, he should surely be able to put his hands on
Dangle with but little delay. Moreover, from the fact that
so many visits had been paid to Antwerp it looked as if
the secret of the gang was hidden in the city. Greatly
reassured, he proceeded to acquire details.</p>

<p>He began by obtaining from M. Marquet’s records lists
of the visits of the three men, and that gentleman’s
identification of the torn bill. Also he pressed him as to whether
he could not remember any questions or conversations
of the trio which might give him a hint as to their business,
but without success. He saw and made a detailed search
of the room Dangle had occupied during his last visit, but
here again with no result. Dangle, M. Marquet said, had
been out all day on the Wednesday, the day after his
arrival, but on Thursday he had remained in the hotel
until his departure about 2:00 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> M. Marquet had not
seen him leave, but he had sent the waiter for his bill after
déjeuner, and the proprietor believed he had gone a little
later. Possibly the porter could give more information on
the point.</p>

<p>The porter was sent for and questioned. He knew M.
Dangle well and recognized his photograph. He had been
present in the hall when the gentleman left on the previous
day, shortly before two o’clock. M. Dangle had walked
out of the hotel with his suitcase in his hand, declining
the porter’s offer to carry it for him or call a taxi. The
trams, however, passed the door, and the porter had
assumed M. Dangle intended to travel by that means. No,
he had not noticed the direction he took. There was a
“stillstand” or tramway halt close by. Dangle had not
talked to the porter further than to wish him good-day
when he met him. He had not asked questions, or given
any hint of his business in the town.</p>

<p>Following his usual procedure under such circumstances,
French next asked for interviews with all those of the staff
who had come in any way in contract with his quarry, but
in spite of his most persistent efforts he could not extract
a single item of information as to the man’s business or
movements.</p>

<p>Baffled and weary from his journey, French took his hat
and went out in the hope that a walk through the streets
of the fine old city would clear his brain and bring him
the inspiration he needed. Crossing beneath the trees of
the Place Verte, he passed round the cathedral to the small
square from which he could look up at the huge bulk of
the west front, with its two unequal towers, one a
climbing marvel of decoration, “lace in stone,” the other
unfinished, and topped with a small and evidently temporary
spire. Then, promising himself a look round the interior
before leaving the town, he regained the tramline from
the Place Verte, and following it westwards, in two or
three minutes came out on the great terraces lining the
banks of the river.</p>

<p>The first sight of the Scheldt was one which French felt
he would not soon forget. Well on to half a mile wide, it
bore away in both directions like a great highway leading
from this little Belgium to the uttermost parts of the earth.
Large ships lay at anchor in it, as well as clustering along
the wharves to the south. This river frontage of wharves
and sheds and cranes and great steamers extended as far
as the eye could reach; he had read that it was three and
a half miles long. And that excluded the huge docks for
which the town was famous. As he strolled along he
became profoundly impressed, not only with the size of
the place, but more particularly with the attention which
had been given to its artistic side. In spite of all this
commercial activity the city did not look sordid. Thought had
been given to its design; one might almost say loving care.
Why, these very terraces on which he was walking, with
their cafés and their splendid view of the river, were
formed on neither more nor less than the vast roofs of the
dock sheds. French, who knew most of the English ports,
felt his amazement grow at every step.</p>

<p>He followed the quays right across the town till he came
to the Gare du Sud, then turning away from the river, he
found himself in the Avenue du Sud. From this he worked
back along the line of great avenues which had replaced
the earlier fortifications, until eventually, nearly three
hours after he had started, he once again turned into the
Place Verte, and reached the Carillon.</p>

<p>He ordered a room for the night, and some strong tea,
after which he sat on in his secluded corner of the
comfortable restaurant, and smoked a meditative cigar. His
walk had done him good. His brain had cleared, and the
weariness of the journey, and the chagrin of his deadlock
had vanished. His thoughts returned to his problem, which
he began to attack in the new.</p>

<p>He puzzled over it for the best part of an hour, without
making the slightest progress, and then he began to
consider how far the ideas he had already arrived at fitted in
with what he had since learned of Dangle’s movements.</p>

<p>He had thought that the nature of the articles on
Dangle’s list suggested a sea expedition. He remembered the
delight with which, many years earlier, he had read <i>The
Riddle of the Sands</i>, and he thought that had Dangle
contemplated just such another cruise as that of the heroes of
that fascinating book, he might well have got together the
articles in question. But since these ideas had passed
through his mind, French had learned the following fresh
facts:</p>

<p>1. From a fortnight after obtaining the tracing, Dangle
had been paying frequent visits to Antwerp.</p>

<p>2. He had on these occasions put up at the Carillon.</p>

<p>3. His last visit had followed immediately on the failure
to murder Cheyne, with its almost certain result of the
calling in of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>4. He had on this last visit remained at the Carillon
for two days, leaving about 2:00 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> on the Thursday,
the previous day.</p>

<p>5. He had carried his hand-bag from the hotel, without
calling for a taxi.</p>

<p>At first French could not see that these additional facts
had any bearing on his theory, but as he continued
turning them over in his mind, he realized that all but one
might be interpreted as tending in the same direction.</p>

<p>1. Dangle’s visits to Antwerp. Supposing Dangle had
been planning some secret marine expedition, where,
French asked himself, could he have found a more suitable
base from which to make his arrangements? Antwerp was
a seaport: moreover, it was a great seaport, large enough
for a secret expedition to set sail from without attracting
notice. It was a foreign port, away from the inquisitive
notice of the British police, but, on the other hand, it was
the nearest great port to London. If these considerations
did not back up his theory, they at least did not conflict
with it.</p>

<p>2. Why had Dangle put up at the Carillon? The hotels
near the station were the obvious ones for English visitors.
Could it be because the Place Verte was close to the river
and the shipping? This, French admitted to himself,
sounded farfetched, and yet it might be the truth.</p>

<p>3. The dispersal and disappearance of the gang
immediately on the probability of its activities becoming known
to the police looked suspiciously like a flight.</p>

<p>4. Could it be that Dangle’s arrival in Antwerp was
ahead of schedule, that is, the flight brought him there two
days before the expedition was to start? Or could it be that
on his arrival he immediately set to work to organize the
departure, but was unable to complete his arrangements
for two days? At least, it might be so.</p>

<p>Lastly, had he carried his bag from the hotel for the
same reason as he might have chosen the hotel: that he
was going, not to the station, but the few hundred yards
to the quays, thence to start on this maritime expedition?
Again, it might be so.</p>

<p>French was fully aware that the whole of these elaborate
considerations had the actual stability of a house of
cards. Each and every one of his deductions might be
erroneous and the facts might be capable of an entirely
different construction. Still, there was at least a suggestion
that Dangle might have left Antwerp by water shortly
after two o’clock on the previous day. It was the one
constructive idea French could evolve, and he decided that
in the absence of anything better he would try to follow
it up.</p>

<p>It was too late to do anything that night. After dinner,
therefore, he had another walk, spent an hour in a
cinema, and then went early to bed, so as to be fresh for
his labors of the following day.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch17">

<h2>Chapter XVII. <br/> On the Flood Tide</h2>

<p>French was astir betimes next morning, and over his
coffee and rolls and honey he laid his plans for the day.
As to the next step of his investigation he had no doubt.
He must begin by finding out what vessels had left the
city after 2:00 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> on the previous Thursday. That
done, he could go into the question of the passengers each
carried, in the hope of learning that Dangle was among
them.</p>

<p>At the outset he was faced by the handicap of being a
stranger in a strange land. If Antwerp had been an
English port he would have known just where to get his
information, but here he was unfamiliar with the ropes. He did
not know if all sailings were published in any paper or
available to the public at any office; moreover, his
ignorance of both French and Flemish precluded his mixing
with clerks or dock loafers from whom he might pick up
information. Of course there were the Belgian police, but
he did not wish to apply to them if he could carry out his
job by himself.</p>

<p>However, this part of his problem proved easier of
solution than he had expected. Inquiries at the post office
revealed the fact that there was a shipping agency in the
Rue des Tanneurs, and soon he had reached the place,
found a clerk who spoke English, and put his question.</p>

<p>When French wished to be suave, as he usually did, he
could, so to speak, have wheedled his best bone from a
bulldog. Now, explaining in a friendly and confidential
manner who he was and why he wanted the information,
he begged the other’s good offices. The clerk, flattered at
being thus courteously approached, showed a willingness
to assist, with the result that in ten minutes French had
the particulars he needed.</p>

<p>He turned into a café, and calling for a bock, sat down
to consider what he had learned. And of this the very first
fact filled him with delight, as it seemed to fit in with the
theory he had evolved.</p>

<p>On Thursday it had been high water at 2:30 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> By
2:30 the dock gates had been opened, and it appeared
that, taking advantage of this, several steamers had left
shortly after that hour.</p>

<p>This was distinctly encouraging, and French turned to
the list of ships with a growing hope that the end of his
investigation might be coming into sight. In all, eleven
steamers had left the port on the day in question, between
the hours of 2:00 and 6:00 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>, the period he had
included in his inquiry.</p>

<p>There was first of all a Canadian Pacific liner, which
had sailed from the quays at 3:00 <span class="sc">p.m.</span>, and at 3:30 a
small passenger boat had left for Oslo and Bergen. The remaining
boats were tramps. There were four coasters, two for
Newcastle, one for Goole, and one for Belfast, a 6,000
tonner for Singapore and the Dutch Islands, another
slightly smaller ship for Genoa and Spezia, and another
for Boston, U.S.A. Then there was a big five-masted sailing
ship, bound with a general cargo for Buenos Aires and
the River Platte, and finally there was a small freighter in
ballast for Casablanca.</p>

<p>Of these eleven ships, the windjammer at once
attracted French’s attention. Here was a vessel on which, if
you took a passage, you might easily require three dozen
tins of peaches before you reached your journey’s end. He
determined to begin with this, taking the other ships in
order according to the position of their offices. Fortunately
in each case the clerk had given him the name of the
owners or agents.</p>

<p>His first call, therefore, was at an old-fashioned office
in a small street close to the Steen Museum. There he
saw M. Leblanc, the owner of the windjammer, and
explained his business. But M. Leblanc could not help
him. The old gentleman had never heard of Dangle nor
had any one resembling his visitor’s photograph called or
done any business with his firm. Moreover, no passengers
had shipped on the windjammer, and the crew that had
sailed was unchanged since the previous voyage.</p>

<p>This was not encouraging, and French went on to the
next item on his program, the headquarters of the small
freighter which had sailed in ballast for Casablanca. She
was owned by Messrs. Merkel &amp; Lowenthal, whose office
was farther down the Rue des Tanneurs, and five minutes
later he had pushed open the door and was inquiring for
the principal.</p>

<p>This was a more modern establishment than that of M.
Leblanc. Though small, the office ran to plate glass
windows, teak furniture, polished brass fittings, and encaustic
tiles, while the two typists he could envisage through the
small inquiry window seemed unduly gorgeous as to
raiment and pert as to demeanor.</p>

<p>He was kept waiting for some minutes, then told that
M. Merkel, the head of the business, was away, but that
M. Lowenthal, the junior partner, would see him.</p>

<p>His first glance told French that M. Lowenthal was a
man to be watched. Seldom had he seen so many of the
tell-tale signs of roguery concentrated in the features of
one person. The junior partner had a mean, sly look, close-set,
shifty eyes which would not meet French’s, and a large
mouth with loose, fleshy lips. His manner was in accord
with his appearance, now blustering, now almost
fulsomely ingratiating. French took an instant dislike to him,
and though he remained courteous as ever, he determined
not to lay his cards on the table.</p>

<p>“My name,” he began, “as you will have seen from my
card, is French, and I carry out the business of a general
agent in London. I am trying to obtain an interview with
a friend, who has been staying here, off and on, for some
time. I came on here from Brussels in the hope of seeing
him, but he had just left. I was told that he had sailed
with your ship, the <i>L’Escaut</i>, on Thursday afternoon, and
if so I called to ask at which port I should be likely to get
in touch with him. His name is Dangle.”</p>

<p>While French spoke he watched the other narrowly, on
his favorite theory that the involuntary replies to
unexpected remarks—starts, changes of expression, sudden
pallors—were more valuable than spoken answers.</p>

<p>But M. Lowenthal betrayed no emotion other than a
mild surprise.</p>

<p>“That iss a very egstraordinary statement, sir,” he said
in heavy guttural tones. “I do not really know who could
haf given you such misleading information. Your friend’s
name is quite unknown to me, and in any case we do not
take passengers on our ships.”</p>

<p>This seemed an entirely reasonable and proper reply,
and yet to French’s highly developed instincts it did not
ring true. However, he could do nothing more, and after
a little further conversation containing not a few veiled
inquiries, all of which, he noted, were skillfully parried by
the other, he apologized for his mistake and withdrew.</p>

<p>Though he was dissatisfied with the interview, he could
only continue his program. He recognized that the
secret might be located in Canada or the States, and that
Dangle might have booked on the C.P.R. liner. Or he
might have gone to Norway—indeed, for the matter of
that, he might have signed on on any of the ships for any
part of the world.</p>

<p>But after a tedious morning of calls and interviews,
French had to confess defeat. He could get no farther. At
none of the offices at which he applied had he obtained the
slightest helpful hint. It began to look as if he had been
mistaken as to Dangle’s sea expedition, and if so, as he
reminded himself with exasperation, he had no alternative
theory to follow up.</p>

<p>He strolled slowly along the pleasant, sunlit streets, as
he reviewed his morning’s work. He was satisfied with all
his interviews but the one. Everywhere save in M.
Lowenthal’s office he felt he had been told the truth. But
instinctively he distrusted the junior partner. That the man had
lied to him he had no reason to suspect, but he had no
doubt that he would do so if it suited his book.</p>

<p>French felt that it was unsatisfactory to leave the
matter in this state, and he presently thought of a simple
subterfuge whereby it might be cleared up. It was almost the
lunch hour, a suitable time for putting his project into
operation. He hurried back to the Rue des Tanneurs, and
turning into a café nearly opposite Messrs. Merkel &amp;
Lowenthal’s premises, ordered a bock and selected a seat
from which he could observe the office door.</p>

<p>He was only just in time. He had not taken his place
five minutes when he saw M. Lowenthal emerge and walk
off towards the center of the town. Three men clerks and
the two rapid-looking typists followed, and lastly there
appeared the person for whom he was waiting—the sharp-looking
office boy who had attended to him earlier in the
day.</p>

<p>The boy turned off in the opposite direction to his
principal—towards a quarter inhabited by laborers and
artisans, and French, getting up from his table, slipped
quietly out of the café and followed him.</p>

<p>The chase continued for some ten minutes, when the
quarry disappeared into a small house in a back street.
French strolled up and down until some half an hour
later the young fellow reappeared. As he approached
French allowed a look of recognition and slight surprise
to appear on his features.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said, pausing with a friendly smile, “you are
the clerk who attended to me this morning in Messrs.
Merkel &amp; Lowenthal’s office, are you not? A piece of luck
meeting you! I wonder if you could give me a piece of
information? I forgot to ask it of M. Lowenthal this morning,
and as I am in a hurry, it would be worth five francs to
me not to have to go back to your office.”</p>

<p>The youth’s eyes had brightened at the suggestion of
financial dealings, and French felt he would learn all the
other could tell him. He therefore continued without
waiting for a reply.</p>

<p>“The thing is this: I am joining my friend, M. Dangle,
aboard the <i>L’Escaut</i> at the first opportunity. It was
arranged between us that one of us should take with him
a couple of dozen of champagne. I want to know whether
he took the stuff, or whether I am to. Can you help me at
all?”</p>

<p>The clerk’s English, though fairly good, was not quite
equal to such a strain, and French had to repeat himself
less idiomatically. But the boy grasped his meaning at
last, and then at once dashed his hopes by saying he had
never heard of any M. Dangle.</p>

<p>“There he is,” French went on, producing his
photograph. “You must have seen him scores of times.”</p>

<p>And then French got the reward of his pertinacity. A
look of recognition passed over the clerk’s features, and he
made a gesture of comprehension.</p>

<p>“<i>Mais oui, m’sieur</i>; yes, sir,” he answered quickly, “but
that is not M. Danggalle. I know him: it is M. Charles.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” French returned, trying to keep the
triumph out of his voice. “His name is Dangle Charles. I
know him as M. Dangle, because he is one of four brothers
at our works. But of course he would give his name here as
M. Charles. But now, can you tell me anything about the
champagne?”</p>

<p>The clerk shook his head. He had not known upon what
business M. Charles had called at the office.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it can’t be helped,” French declared. “I
thought that perhaps when he was in with you last
Wednesday you might have heard something about it. You
don’t know what luggage he took aboard the <i>L’Escaut</i>?”</p>

<p>The clerk had not been aware that M. Charles had
embarked on the freighter, still less did he know of what
his luggage had consisted. But as French talked on in his
pleasant way, the following facts became apparent; first,
that Dangle for some weeks past had been an occasional
visitor at the shipping office; second, that on the previous
Wednesday he had been closeted with the partners for the
greater part of the day; third, that the <i>L’Escaut</i> had
evidently sailed on an expedition of considerable importance
and length, for a vast deal of stores had gone aboard her,
about which both partners had shown very keen anxiety;
fourthly, that not only had M. Merkel, the senior partner,
himself sailed on her, but it was likely that he intended to
be away some time as M. Lowenthal had moved into his
room, and lastly, that the <i>L’Escaut</i> had come up from the
firm’s yard during the Wednesday night and had anchored
in the river off the Steen until she left about 3:00 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> on the Thursday.</p>

<p>These admissions made it abundantly clear that French
was once more on the right track, and he handed over his
five francs with the feeling that he had made the cheapest
bargain of his life.</p>

<p>He had no doubt that Dangle had sailed with the senior
partner on the tramp, but he felt he must make sure, and
he walked slowly back towards the quays, turning over in
his mind possible methods for settling the point. One
inquiry seemed promising. If the ship had lain at anchor
out in the river, and if Dangle had gone aboard her, he
must have had a boat to do so. French wondered could he
find that boat.</p>

<p>He felt himself held up by the language difficulty. Up to
the present he had had extraordinary luck in this respect,
but then up to the present he had been interviewing
educated persons whose business brought them in contact with
foreigners. He doubted if he could make boatmen and
loafers about the quays understand what he wanted.</p>

<p>A trial convinced him that his fears were well founded,
and he lost a solid hour in finding the Berlitz School and
engaging a young linguist with a reputation for discretion.
Then, accompanied by M. Jules Renard, he returned to
the quays and set systematically to work. He began by
inquiring where boats might be hired, and where there
were steps at which ships’ boats might come alongside.
Taking these in turn he asked had the boatmen taken a
passenger out to the <i>L’Escaut</i> between 2:00 and 3:00 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> on the previous Thursday? Or had the loafer, stevedore,
shunter, or constable, as the case might be, noticed if a
boat had come ashore from the same vessel on the same
date and at the same time?</p>

<p>Though the work was easy it bade fair to be tedious,
and therefore for more than one reason French felt a glow
of satisfaction when at his fourth inquiry his question
received an affirmative answer. A wizened old man, one of
a small knot of longshoremen whom M. Renard addressed,
separated himself from his companions and came forward.
He said that he was a boatman, and that he had been
hailed by a man—an Englishman, he believed—at the time
stated, and had rowed him out to the ship.</p>

<p>“Ask him if that’s the man,” French directed, producing
Dangle’s photograph, though he felt there could be no
doubt as to the reply.</p>

<p>He was therefore immensely dashed when the boatman
shook his head. This was not the man at all. The traveler
was a short, rather stout man with a small fair mustache.</p>

<p>French gasped. The description sounded familiar.
Taking out Blessington’s photograph he passed it over.</p>

<p>This time the boatman nodded. Yes, that was the man
he had rowed out. He had no doubt of him whatever.</p>

<p>This was unexpected but most welcome news, though as
French thought over it, he saw that it was not so surprising
after all. If Dangle was in it, why not Blessington, and for
the matter of that, why not Sime also? In this case he
wondered where Susan could be, and more acutely, what
had been the fate of Joan Merrill. Possibly, he thought, his
inquiries about Dangle would solve these questions also.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he struck oil for the second time.
Another boatman, a little further along the quays, had
also rowed a passenger out to the <i>L’Escaut</i>, and this one, it
appeared, was Dangle. But though French kept working
steadily away, he could hear nothing of Sime.</p>

<p>In the end it was a suggestion of Renard’s that put him
once more on the trail. The interpreter proved an
intelligent youth, and when he had grasped the point at issue,
he stopped and pointed to the river.</p>

<p>“You say, monsieur, that the sheep, she lie there, opposite
the Musée Steen, is it not so? <i>Bon!</i> We haf walked along
all the quays near to that. Your friends would not haf
hired boat from farther on—it is too far. You say, too, they
come from England secretly, is it not? <i>Bon!</i> They would
come to the other side.”</p>

<p>French did not understand.</p>

<p>“The other side?” he repeated questioningly.</p>

<p>“But yes, monsieur, the other side.” The young fellow’s
eyes flashed in his eagerness. “Over there, La Gare de
Waes.” He pointed out across the great stream to its west
bank.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there was a station across there,” French
admitted. “Where does the line go to?”</p>

<p>“Direct to Ghent. Your friends change trains at Ghent.
It is a quiet railway. They come unseen.”</p>

<p>“Good man,” said French heartily. “We’ll go and find out.
How do you get to the blessed place?”</p>

<p>M. Renard smiled delightedly.</p>

<p>“Ah yes, monsieur. You weesh to cross? Is it not?” he
cried. “This way. We take ferry from the Quai Van Dyck.
It is near.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later they had reached the Tête de Flandre—the
low-lying western bank of the Scheldt. It bore a
small but not unpicturesque cluster of old-fashioned houses,
nestling about one of the historic Antwerp forts. Renard,
now apparently quite as interested in the chase as French,
led the way along the river bank from boatman to
boatman, with the result that before very many minutes had
passed French had obtained the information he wanted.</p>

<p>It appeared that about 1:00 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> on the day in
question, a strapping young boatman had noticed three strangers
approaching from the direction of the Waes Station, a
hundred yards or more distant. They consisted of a tall,
clean-shaven man of something under middle age and two
women, both young. One was tall and strongly made and
dark as to hair and eyes, the other was slighter and with
red gold hair. The smaller one seemed to be ill, and was
stumbling along between the other two, each of whom
supported her by an arm. None of the trio could speak
French or Flemish, but they managed by signs to convey
the information that they wanted to be put on board
the <i>L’Escaut</i>, which was lying out in midstream. The man
had rowed them out, and they had been received on board
by an elderly gentleman with a dark beard.</p>

<p>Further questions produced the information that the fair
lady appeared to be seriously ill, though whether it was her
mind or body that was affected, the boatman couldn’t be
sure. She was able to walk, but would not do so unless
urged on by the others. She had not spoken or taken any
interest in the journey. She had not appeared even to look
round her, but had sat gazing listlessly at nothing, with a
vacant expression in her eyes. Her companions had had
real difficulty in getting her up the short ladder on to
the <i>L’Escaut’s</i> deck.</p>

<p>The news was rather unexpected to French. About Joan
Merrill it was both disconcerting and reassuring; the
former because he could not see that the gang had anything
but a sinister reason for inveigling the young girl aboard
the ship—probably she will fall overboard at night, he
thought; the latter because she was at least still alive, or
had been two days ago. It was quite evident that she was
drugged, probably with morphine or something similar. It
might, however, mean that while wishing Joan no harm,
they were taking her with them on their expedition to
insure her silence as to their movements.</p>

<p>As French returned across the ferry, he kept on puzzling
as to Lowenthal’s position. Could Lowenthal be arrested?
Was he in league with the gang? If so, could he be held
responsible for the abduction of Joan Merrill? French
didn’t think the evidence would justify drastic measures.
He had, as a matter of fact, no actual evidence against
Lowenthal. Of his complicity he was satisfied, but he
doubted if he could prove it.</p>

<p>He got rid of the young interpreter, and strolling slowly
along the quays, thought the matter out. No, he had not a
enough case with which to go to the Belgian police.
But he could do the next best thing. He could call on
M. Lowenthal for the second time, and try to bluff an
admission out of him.</p>

<p>As he walked to the Rue des Tanneurs, he felt his
prospects were not rosy. But at least he had no difficulty in
obtaining his interview. M. Lowenthal seemed surprised to
see him so soon again, but received him politely, and asked
what he could do for him.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you another question, M. Lowenthal, if
you please,” French answered in his pleasantest manner,
“and first I must tell you that the agency I hold is that
of Detective Inspector at New Scotland Yard in London.
My question is this: When you and M. Merkel entered
into relations with Blessington, Sime, and the Dangles, did
you know that they were dangerous criminals wanted by
the English police?”</p>

<p>In spite of the most evident efforts for self-control,
Lowenthal was so much taken aback that he could not for
some moments speak. His swarthy face turned a greenish
hue and little drops of sweat showed on his forehead. To
the other pleasant characteristics with which French had
mentally endowed him, he now added that of coward, and
his hopes of his bluff succeeding grew brighter. He sat
waiting in silence for the other to recover himself, then
said suavely:</p>

<p>“After that, M. Lowenthal, you will see for yourself that
you cannot plead ignorance of the affair. Let me advise
you for your own sake to be open with me.”</p>

<p>The man pulled himself together. He wiped his brow as
he replied earnestly, but in somewhat shaky accents:</p>

<p>“That I haf met Blessington, Sime, and Dangle I do not
deny, though they were Merkel’s friends—not mine. But I
do not know that they are criminal. Dangle, he called here
and asked Merkel to take him on the next”—he hesitated
for a word—“next work, next sail of the sheep. Merkel
said that Dangle iss a writer—he writes books. He weeshed
to see the sail to Casablanca to deescribe it in hiss book.
Merkel said he would haf to pay fare, the firm could not
afford it unless. Dangle agreed. Merkel was going himself,
and Dangle suggested Sime and Blessington go also to
make party—to play cards. Of a second Dangle I know
nothing. They went secretly—I admit it—because the law
forbids to take passengers for sail without a certificate.
That is all of the affair.”</p>

<p>Not a single word of this statement did French believe,
but he saw that unless he could get some further
information, or surprise this Lowenthal into some more damaging
admission, he could not have him arrested. After all, the
story hung together. Merkel might conceivably be playing
his own game, and have pitched the yarn of the author
out for copy to his partner. The contravention of the
shipping laws would undoubtedly account for the secrecy with
which the start was made. Certainly there was no evidence
to bring before a jury.</p>

<p>French proceeded to question the junior partner with
considerable thoroughness, but he could not shake his
statement. The only additional facts he learned were that
the <i>L’Escaut</i> was going to Casablanca on the order of the
Moroccan Government to load up a cargo of agricultural
samples for the Italian market, and that M. Merkel was
accompanying it simply as a holiday trip.</p>

<p>With this French had to be content, and he went to the
post office, and got through on the long distance telephone
to his chief at the Yard. To him he repeated the essentials
of the tale, asking him to inquire from the Moroccan
authorities as to the truth of their portion of it, as well as
to endeavor to trace the <i>L’Escaut</i>.</p>

<p>On leaving the post office, it occurred to him that
communication with the <i>L’Escaut</i> should be possible by
wireless, and he returned to the Rue des Tanneurs to ascertain
this point. There he was told that just after he had left
M. Lowenthal had received a telephone call, requiring his
immediate presence in Holland, and he had with a great
rush caught the afternoon express for the Dutch capital.</p>

<p>“Skedaddled, by Jove!” said French to himself. “Guess
that lets in the Belgian police.”</p>

<p>He called at headquarters, and saw the officer in charge,
and before he left to catch the connection for London, it
had been arranged that the movements of the junior
partner should be gone into, and a watch kept for the return
of that enterprising weaver of fairy tales.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVIII. <br/> A Visitor from India</h2>

<p>When French reached Victoria, the first person he saw on
the platform was Maxwell Cheyne.</p>

<p>“They told me at the Yard that you might be on this
train,” the young man said excitedly as he elbowed his
way forward. “Any news? Anything about Miss Merrill?”</p>

<p>He looked old and worn, and it was evident that his
anxiety was telling on him. In his eagerness he could
scarcely wait for the Inspector to dismount from his
carriage, and his loud tones were attracting curious looks
from the bystanders.</p>

<p>“Get a taxi,” French answered quietly. “We can talk
there.”</p>

<p>A few seconds later they found a vehicle, and Cheyne,
gripping the other by the arm, went on earnestly:</p>

<p>“Tell me. I can see you have learned something. Is she—all
right?”</p>

<p>“I got news of her on Thursday last. She was all right
then, though still under the influence of a drug. The whole
party has gone to sea.”</p>

<p>“To sea?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to sea in a small tramp. I don’t know what they
are up to, but there is no reason to suppose Miss Merrill is
otherwise than well. Probably they took her with them to
prevent her giving them away. They would drug her to get
her to go along, but would cease it as soon as she was on
board. I wired for inquiries to be made at the different
signal stations, and news may be waiting for us at the
Yard.”</p>

<p>A few seconds sufficed to put Cheyne in possession of
the salient facts which French had learned, and the latter
in his turn asked for news.</p>

<p>“By Jove, yes!” Cheyne cried, “there is news. You
remember that Arnold Price had disappeared? Well,
yesterday I had a letter from him!”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so?” French rejoined in surprise.
“Where did he write from?”</p>

<p>“Bombay. He was shortly leaving for home. He expects
to be here in about a month.”</p>

<p>“And what about his disappearance?”</p>

<p>“He was ill in hospital. He had gone up to Agra on
some private business and met with an accident—was
knocked down in the street and was insensible for ages.
He couldn’t say who he was, and the hospital people in
Agra couldn’t find out, and he hadn’t told the Bombay
people where he was going to spend his leave.”</p>

<p>“Did he mention the letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he thanked me for taking charge of it and said
that when he reached home he would relieve me of further
trouble about it. He little knows!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” French assented.</p>

<p>Their taxi had been held up by a block at the end of
Westminster Bridge, but now the mass cleared and in a
few seconds they reached the Yard.</p>

<p>French’s first care was to get rid of Cheyne. He repeated
what he had learned about Joan Merrill, then, assuring
him that the key of the matter lay in the cipher, he
advised him to go home and try it once more. Directly any
more news came in he would let him know.</p>

<p>Cheyne having reluctantly taken his departure, French
made inquiries as to what had been done in reference to
his telephone from Antwerp. It appeared that the Yard
had not been idle. In the first place an application had
been made to the Moroccan Government, who had replied
that no ship had been chartered by them for freight at
Casablanca, nor was anything known of agricultural
samples for the Italian market. Lowenthal’s story must
therefore have been an absolute fabrication. He had, however,
told it so readily that French suspected it had been made
up beforehand, so as to be ready to serve up to any
inquisitive policeman or detective who might come along.</p>

<p>Next Lloyd’s had been approached, as to the direction
the <i>L’Escaut</i> had taken, and a reply had shortly before
come in from them. It stated that up to noon on that day,
the vessel had not been reported from any of their stations.
But this, French realized, might not mean so much. If she
had gone south down the English Channel it would have
been well on to dark before she reached the Straits of Dover.
In any case, had she wished to slip through unseen, she
had only to keep out to the middle of the passage, when
in ordinary weather she would have been invisible from
either coast. On the other hand, had she gone north, she
would almost naturally have kept out of sight of land. It
was true that in either case she would have been likely to
pass some other vessel which would have spoken her, and
the fact that no news of such a recognition had come to
hand seemed to indicate that she was taking some unusual
course out of the track of regular shipping.</p>

<p>French wired this information to the Antwerp police,
and then, his chief being disengaged, went in and gave
him a detailed account of his adventures in Belgium.</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Mitchell was impressed by the story. He
sat back in his chair and treated French to a prolonged
stare as the latter talked. At the end of the recital he
remained sitting motionless for some moments, whistling
gently below his breath.</p>

<p>“Any theories?” he said at last.</p>

<p>French shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, no, sir,” he answered slowly. “It’s not easy to see
what they’re after. And it’s not easy to see, either, why the
whole gang wanted to go. It looked at first as if they were
just clearing out because of Cheyne’s coming to the Yard,
but it’s more than that. The arrangements were made too
long ago. They have been dealing with that Antwerp firm
for several weeks.”</p>

<p>“The hard copper was all a story?”</p>

<p>“Looks like it, sir. As a matter of fact every single
statement those men made that could be tested has been proved
false. Even when there didn’t seem any great object in a
yarn they pitched it. Lies seemed to come easier to them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve known a good few cases of that, and so have
you, French. It’s a habit that grows. Now, what’s your next
move?”</p>

<p>French hesitated.</p>

<p>“For the moment the outlook’s not very cheery,” he said
at last. “All the same I can’t believe that boat can go
away out of the Scheldt and disappear. In my judgment
she’s bound to be reported before long, and I’m looking
forward to getting word of her within the next day or so.
Then I have no doubt that the tracing is some kind of
cipher, and if we could read it we should probably get
light on the whole affair.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t you read it? Try it again.”</p>

<p>“I intend to, sir. But I don’t hope for much result,
because I don’t believe we’ve got the genuine document.
I don’t believe they would have handed it, nor a copy of
it either, to a man they intended to murder, lest it should
be found on his body. I’d state long odds they gave him
a fake.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re probably right,” the chief admitted.
“Try at all events. You never know your luck.”</p>

<p>He bent over his desk, and French, realizing that the
interview had come to an end, quietly left the room. Then,
seeing there was nothing requiring his attention urgently,
and tired after his journey, he went home.</p>

<p>But contrary to his expectations, the next day passed
without any news of the <i>L’Escaut</i>, and the next, and many
days after that. Nor could all his efforts with the tracing
throw any light on that mysterious document. As time
passed he began to grow more and more despondent, and
the fear that he was going to make a mess of the case
grew steadily stronger. In vain he laid his difficulties before
his wife. For once that final source of inspiration failed
him. Mrs. French did not take even one illuminating
notion. When the third week had gone by, something akin
to despair seized upon the Inspector. The only possibility
of hope now seemed to lie in the return of Arnold Price,
and French began counting the days until his arrival.</p>

<p>One night about three weeks after his return from
Belgium he settled down with a cigar after dinner, his
thoughts running in their familiar groove: What were
these people engaged on? Was there any way in which he
could find out? Had he overlooked any evidence or any
inquiries? Had he neglected any possible line of research?</p>

<p>The more he considered the affair in all its bearings, the
more conscious he became of the soundness of the advice
he had given to Cheyne, and which in his turn he had
received from his chief. Unquestionably in the tracing lay
the solution he required, and once again he racked his
brains to see if he could not by any means devise a way
to read its message.</p>

<p>On this point he concentrated, going over and over
again everything he had learned about it. For perhaps an
hour he remained motionless in his chair, while the smoke
from his cigar curled up and slowly dissolved into the blue
haze with which the room was becoming obscured. And
then suddenly he sat up and with a dawning, tremulous
eagerness considered an idea which had just leaped into
his mind.</p>

<p>He had suddenly remembered a statement made by
Cheyne when he was giving his first rather incoherent
account of his adventures. The young man said that it had
been arranged between himself and Joan Merrill that if
either were lucky enough to get the tracing into his or her
possession, the first thing he or she would do would be to
photograph it. Now, in juxtaposition with that statement,
French recalled the facts, first, that Joan must have
reached her flat on the night of her abduction at least
several minutes before Blessington and Sime arrived with
their car; and secondly, that during those minutes she had
the tracing with her—the genuine tracing, as there was
every reason to believe. <em>Had Joan photographed it?</em></p>

<p>French was overwhelmed with amazement and chagrin
at his failure to think of this point before, nor could he
acquit Cheyne of a like astounding stupidity. For himself
he felt there was no excuse whatever. He had even specially
noticed the girl’s camera and the flashlight apparatus
which she used for her architectural details when he was
searching her rooms, but he had then, and since then up
till this moment, entirely and completely forgotten the
arrangement made between the partners.</p>

<p>Late as it was, French decided to go then and there to
ascertain the point. The key of Joan’s flat was at the Yard,
and twenty minutes later he had obtained it and was in a
taxi bowling towards Horne Terrace.</p>

<p>He kept the vehicle while he ran up the ten flights to
No. 12 and secured the camera. Then hastening down, he
was driven back to the Yard.</p>

<p>By a piece of good luck he found a photographer who
had been delayed by other important work, and him he
pressed into the service forthwith. With some grumbling
the man returned to his dark room. French, too eager to
await his report, accompanying him.</p>

<p>A few moments sufficed to settle the question. The
camera contained a roll of films of which the first seven
had been exposed, and a short immersion in the developer
showed that numbers 5, 6, and 7 bore the hoped for
impress.</p>

<p>Gone was French’s despondency and the weariness
caused by his heavy day, and instead he was once more
the embodiment of enthusiasm and cheery optimism. He
had it now! At last the secret was within his grasp! Of his
ability to read the message, now that he was sure he had
the genuine one, he had no doubt. He had always liked
working out ciphers, and since he had succeeded in
extracting the hidden meaning from the stock and share
list which had been sent to the elusive Mrs. X in the
Gething murder case, his belief in his own powers had
become almost an obsession. He could hardly restrain his
eagerness to get to grips with this new problem until the
negatives should be dry and prints made.</p>

<p>The photographer was able to promise these for the
following day, and till then French had to possess his soul
in patience. But on his return from lunch he found on his
desk three excellent prints of the document.</p>

<p>They were only half-plate size, or about one-third that
of the tracing which had been given to Cheyne. He
therefore instructed the photographer to prepare enlargements
which would bring the document up to more nearly the
size of the original. These were ready before it was time
for him to leave for home, and he sat down with
ill-controlled excitement to compare them with the document
at which he had already spent so much time.</p>

<p>And then he suddenly experienced one of the most bitter
disappointments of his life. To all intents and purposes the
two were the same! There were the same circles, the same
numbers, letters, and signs enclosed therein, the same
phrase, “England expects every man to do his duty,”
spaced round in the same way! The tracing had not been
very accurately done, as some of the circles seemed slightly
out of place, but the discrepancies were trifling, and
seemed obviously due to careless copying. He gave vent to
a single bitter oath, then sat motionless, wrapped in the
most profound gloom.</p>

<p>He took tracing and photographs home with him, and
spent the greater part of the evening making a minute
comparison between the two. The enlargement unfortunately
was not exactly the same size as the tracing, and
he therefore began his work by covering the surfaces of
both with proportionate squares.</p>

<p>Taking the tracing first he drew parallel lines one inch
apart both up and down it and across, thus covering its
whole surface with inch squares. Then he divided the
prints into the same number of equal parts both vertically
and horizontally and ruled them up in squares also. These
squares were slightly smaller than the others—about
seven-eighths of an inch only—but relatively the lines fell on
each in the same positions. A comparison according to the
squares thus showed at a glance similarity or otherwise
between the two documents.</p>

<p>As he examined them in detail certain interesting facts
began to emerge. The general appearance, the words
“England expects every man to do his duty,” and the
circles with their attendant letters and numbers were
identical on both sheets. But there were striking variations. The
position of certain of the circles was different. Those
containing numbers and crooked lines were all slightly out of
place, while those containing letters remained unmoved.
Moreover, the little crooked lines, while preserving a rough
resemblance to the originals, were altered in shape. The
more he considered the matter the more evident it became
to French that these divergences were intentional. The
tracing which had been given to Cheyne was intended to
resemble the other superficially—and did so resemble it,
but it had clearly been faked to make it valueless.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="A full-page image of dozens of circles. Their arrangement appears to be random. Most circles contains either a letter or a number, with the numbers ranging from 1 to 36. Eight or nine circles instead contain a short, irregularly-shaped line. Words are placed in between the circles, arranged in a loop through the entire image, reading clockwise “England expects every man to do his duty”." src="images/tracing.png" id="img_images_tracing.png"/>
</figure>

<p>If French were right so far, and he had but little doubt
of it, it followed that the essential feature of the circles
and crooked lines was position. This, he felt, should be a
useful hint, but as yet he could not see where it led.</p>

<p>He pondered fruitlessly over the problem till the small
hours, and next morning he took the documents back to
the Yard to continue his studies. But he did not have an
opportunity to do so. Other work was waiting for him. To
his delight he found that Arnold Price had reached home,
and that he and Cheyne were waiting to see him.</p>

<p>Price proved to be a lanky and rather despondent-looking
individual with a skin burned to the color of
copper and a pair of exceedingly shrewd blue eyes. He dropped
into the chair French indicated, and instantly pulled out
and lit a well-blackened cutty pipe.</p>

<p>“Got in yesterday morning,” he announced laconically,
“and wired Torquay I was going down. By the merest luck
I got a reply before I started that Cheyne was in town. I
looked him up and here I am.”</p>

<p>French smiled pleasantly. Though interested in the man,
he could not help noting with some amusement at once
the restraint and the completeness of his statement. How
refreshing, he thought, and how rare, to meet some one
who will give you the pith of a story without frills!</p>

<p>“I’m glad to meet you, Mr. Price,” he said cordially.
“I suppose Mr. Cheyne has told you the effect that your
letter has had on us all?”</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>“Not altogether surprising,” he declared. “There’s
money in the thing—or so I always believed, and this other
crowd must believe it too; though how they got on to the
affair licks me.”</p>

<p>“We shall be very much interested to hear what you can
tell us about it,” French prompted. “Will you smoke, Mr.
Cheyne?” He held out his cigar case.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you much,” Price returned, “and nothing
that will clear up this blessed mystery that seems to have
started up. But this is my story for what it’s worth. Before
the war I was on one of the Hudson and Spence boats
and I had the luck to get into the R.N.R. when hostilities
broke out. I stayed on in my old ship till she was torpedoed
a couple of years later, then I was appointed third officer
on the <i>Maurania</i>. We were on a trip from South Africa to
Brest with army stores, when one day, just as we came into
the English Channel, we were attacked by a U-boat. We
had an 18-pounder forward, and by a stroke of luck we
gave old Fritz one on the knob that did him in. The boat
went down and a dozen of the crew were left swimming.
We put out a boat and picked one or two of them up.
The skipper was clinging on to a lifebelt, but just as we
came up he let go and began to sink. I was in charge of
the boat, and some fool notion came over me—I think in
the hurry I forgot he was a U-boat skipper—but anyhow
like a fool I got overboard and got hold of him. It was
nothing like a dramatic rescue—there was no danger to
me—and we were back on board inside fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>French and Cheyne were listening intently to this
familiar story. So far it was almost word for word that told
by Dangle. Apparently, then, there was at least one point
on which the latter had told the truth.</p>

<p>“We weren’t out of trouble,” Price resumed, “and next
day we came up against another submarine. We exchanged
a few shots and then a British destroyer came up and drove
him off. But I had the luck to stop a splinter of shell, and
when we got to Brest I was sent to hospital. The U-boat
skipper had got a crack on the head when his boat went
down, and he was sent in too. By a chance we got side by
side beds in the same ward, and used to talk a bit, though
he was a rotter, even for a Boche.”</p>

<p>Price paused to draw on his cutty pipe, expelling great
clouds of smoke of a peculiarly acrid and penetrating
quality. Then, the others not speaking, he went on:</p>

<p>“It turned out that the wound on Schulz’s head—his
name was Schulz—was serious, and he grew steadily worse.
Then one night when the ward was quiet, he woke me and
said he knew his number was up and that he had a secret
to tell me. We listened, but all the other fellows seemed
asleep, and then he told me he could put me in the way of
a fortune—that he had hoped to get it himself after the
war, but now that it would be a job for someone else. He
said he would tell me the whole thing, and that I might
make what I could out of it, if only I would pledge myself
to give one-eighth of what I got to his wife. He gave me
the address—somewhere in Breslau. He asked me to swear
this and I did, and then he took a packet from under his
pillow and handed it to me. ‘There,’ he said, ‘the whole
thing’s there. I put it in cipher for safety, but I’ll tell you
how to read it.’ Well, he began to do so, but just then a
sister came in, and he shut up till she would leave. But
the excitement of talking about the thing must have been
too much for him. He got a weak turn and never spoke
again.”</p>

<p>“But,” Cheyne interposed, “what about the hard
copper? Dangle told us about Schulz’s discovery.”</p>

<p>Price gazed at him vacantly for some moments and then
suddenly smote the table.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” he cried with an oath. “Dangle! I remember
that chap now! He was in the next bed on the other
side of Schulz. That’s right! I couldn’t call him to mind
when you mentioned him before. Of course! He heard the
whole tale, and that’s what started him on this do.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Cheyne returned. “He admitted that all right.
But he told us about the hard copper. You haven’t
mentioned that.”</p>

<p>Price shook his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t know what you’re talking about,” he declared.
“What do you mean by hard copper?”</p>

<p>“Dangle mentioned it. He was listening to the conversation.
He told us all that about Schulz’s story of the fortune,
and about his wife and all that, just as you have,
but he said Schulz went on to explain what the fortune
was: that he had hit on a way of treating copper that made
it as hard as steel. The cipher contained the formula.”</p>

<p>Again Price shook his head.</p>

<p>“All spoof,” he observed. “Not a word of truth in it.
Schulz never mentioned copper or said anything more than
I’ve told you.”</p>

<p>French spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>“We found this Dangle a man of imagination, all
through, and it is easy to see why he invented that particular
yarn. By that time he had undoubtedly read the cipher,
and he wanted something to mislead Mr. Cheyne as to its
contents. The story of the hard copper would start a bias
in Mr. Cheyne’s mind which would tend to keep him off
the real scent.” He paused, but his companions not
speaking, continued: “Now we have that bias cleared away, at
least one interesting fact emerges. The whole business
starts with the sea—the U-boat commander, Schulz, and
it looks as if it was going to end up with the sea, the
tramp, the <i>L’Escaut</i>.”</p>

<p>As French said these words an idea flashed into his
mind, and he went on deliberately, but with growing
excitement:</p>

<p>“And when we connect the idea of a U-boat commander
giving a message which ends with a sea expedition,
with the fact, which I have just discovered, that the
essence of his cipher is the <em>position</em> of the markings on it,
we seem to be getting somewhere.”</p>

<p>Price smote his thigh.</p>

<p>“By Jemima!” he cried. “I’ve got you. That blessed
tracing is a map!”</p>

<p>“A map, yes. That’s what I think,” French answered
eagerly, and then as suddenly he saw the possible
significance of Nelson’s exhortation, he went on dramatically:
“A map of England!”</p>

<p>Cheyne swore softly.</p>

<p>“My word, if we aren’t a set of blithering idiots!” he
exclaimed. “Of course! ‘England’ is the title. That’s as
clear as day! The other words are added as a blind. Let’s
have the thing out, Inspector, and see if we can’t make
something of it now.”</p>

<p>As French produced his enlarged photographs not one
of the three men doubted that they were at last well on
the way towards wresting the secret from the document
which had so long baffled them.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop"/>

<div class="chapter" id="ch19">

<h2>Chapter XIX. <br/> The Message of the Tracing</h2>

<p>Inspector French spread the photograph on his desk,
and Cheyne and Price having drawn up chairs, all three
gazed at it as if expecting that in the light of their great
idea its message would have become obvious.</p>

<p>But in this they were disappointed. The suggestion did
not seem in any way to help either French or Cheyne, and
Price, who of course had not seen the document before, was
satisfactorily mystified. Granted that the thing was a map,
granted even that it was a map of England, its meaning
remained just as provokingly hidden as ever.</p>

<p>Presently Price gave vent to an exclamation. “Hang it
all!” he cried irritably, and then: “I suppose those numbers
couldn’t be soundings? Could they give depths at the
circles?”</p>

<p>“That’s an idea,” Cheyne cried, but French shook his
head.</p>

<p>“I think there’s more in it than that,” he observed. “If
you examine those numbers you’ll find that they’re
consecutive, they run from one to thirty-six. Soundings wouldn’t
lend themselves to such an arrangement. You may be right,
Mr. Price, and we must keep your idea in view, but I don’t
see it working out for the moment.”</p>

<p>Silence reigned for a few moments, then Price sat back
from the table and spoke again.</p>

<p>“Look here, Inspector,” he said, knocking the ashes out
of his pipe and beginning to fill it with his strong, black
mixture, “you said something just now I didn’t quite
follow. Let’s get your notion clear. You talked of this thing
beginning with the sea—at Schulz, and ending with the
sea—at <i>L’Escaut</i>, and Schulz’s message being a map. Just
what was in your mind?”</p>

<p>“Only the obvious suggestion that if you leave a message
which provokes an expedition, you must also convey in
your message the destination of that expedition, and a map
seems the simplest way of doing it. But on second thoughts
I question my first conclusion. There must be an explanation
of the secret as well as a direction of how to profit by
it, and it would seem to me doubtful that such an
explanation could be covered by a map.”</p>

<p>“Sounds all right, that,” Price admitted. “Have you any
idea what the secret might be? Sounds like treasure or
salvage or something of that kind.”</p>

<p>“I scarcely think salvage,” French answered. “The <i>L’Escaut</i>
is not a salvage boat, and a boat not specially
fitted for the purpose would be of little use. But I thought
of treasure all right. This Schulz might have robbed his
ships—there would always be money aboard, and even
during the war many women traveled with jewelry. The
man might easily have made a cache of valuables
somewhere round the coast.”</p>

<p>“Easily,” Cheyne intervened, “or he might have learned
of some valuable deposit in some out of the way cove
round the coast, like those chaps in that clinking tale of
Maurice Drake’s, <i>WO₂</i>.”</p>

<p>“As at Terneuzen?” said French. “I read that book—one
of the best I ever came across. It’s a possibility, of
course.”</p>

<p>The talk here became somewhat rambling, Price not
having read <i>WO₂</i> and wanting to know what it was about,
but French soon reverted to his photograph. He reminded
his hearers that they were all interested in its elucidation.
Miss Merrill’s safety, his own professional credit, Cheyne’s
peace of mind, and Price’s fortune, all were at stake.</p>

<p>“We have,” he went on, “evolved the idea that perhaps
this tracing may be a map of England. On further thought
that suggestion does not seem promising, but as we have
no other let us work on it. Assume it is a map of England,
and let us see if it leads us anywhere.” There were
murmurs of assent from his hearers, and he continued: “Now
it seems to me the first thing to do is to try if we can fit
these circles and lines into the map of England. Is there
anything corresponding to them in English geography?”</p>

<p>No one being able to answer this query, French went on:</p>

<p>“I think we must distinguish between the letter circles
on the one hand and those of the numbers and lines on
the other. The position of the former was not altered in
the faked copy; that of the latter was. From this may we
not assume that the message lies in the numbers and lines
only? Possibly the letters were added as a blind, as we have
already assumed the words ‘expects every man to do his
duty’ were added as a blind to ‘England.’ Suppose at all
events that we eliminate the letter circles and concentrate
on the others for our first effort?”</p>

<p>“That sounds all right.”</p>

<p>“Good. Then let us go a step further. Have you noticed
the distribution of the numbers, letters and lines? The
numbers are bunched, roughly speaking, towards the
center, the letters round the edge, and the irregular lines
between the two. Does this central mass give us anything?”</p>

<p>“I get you,” Price replied. He had risen and begun to
pace the room, but now he returned to the table and stood
looking down at the photograph. “You know, as a matter of
fact,” he went on slowly, “if, as you say, you take that
central part which contains numbers only, the shape of the
thing is not so very unlike England after all. Suppose the
numbers represent land and the letters sea. Then this
patch of letters in the top left-hand corner might be the
Irish Sea, and this larger patch to the right the North Sea.
And look, the letter circles form a band across the bottom.
What price that for the English Channel?”</p>

<p>French crossed the room, and taking a small atlas from
a shelf, opened it at the map of England and laid it down
beside the photograph. With a rising excitement all three
compared them. Then Cheyne burst out irritably:</p>

<p>“Confound the thing! It’s like it and it’s not like it.
Let’s draw a line round those number circles and see if it
makes anything like the shape.” He seized the photograph
and took out a pencil.</p>

<p>But just as in the scientific and industrial worlds
discoveries and inventions seldom come singly, so among
these three men the begetting of ideas begot more ideas.
Scarcely had Cheyne spoken when French made a little
gesture of comprehension.</p>

<p>“I believe I have it at last,” he said quietly but with
ill-concealed eagerness in his tones. “Those irregular lines
in certain of the circles are broken bits of the coast line.
See here, those two between 8 and U are surely the Wash,
and that below H is Flamborough Head. Let’s see if we
can locate correspondingly shaped outlines on the atlas, and
fill in between those on the photograph with pencil.”</p>

<p>A few seconds’ examination only were needed. Opposite,
but slightly above the projection which French suggested
as Flamborough Head was an angled line between GU
and 31 which all three simultaneously pronounced St.
Bee’s Head. Short double lines on each side of 24 showed
two parts of the estuary of the Severn, and projections along
the bottom near X and 27 were evidently St. Alban’s Head
and Selsey Bill.</p>

<p>That they were on the right track there could now no
longer be any doubt, and they set themselves with renewed
energy to the problem still remaining—the meaning of the
circles and the numbers they contained.</p>

<p>“We can’t locate the blessed things this way,” French
pointed out. “We’ll have to rule squares on the atlas to
correspond. Then we can pencil in the coast line accurately,
and see just where the circles lie.”</p>

<p>For a time measuring and the drawing of lines were the
order of the day. And then at last the positions of the
circles were located. They were all drawn round towns.</p>

<p>“Towns!” Price exclaimed. “Guess we’re getting on.”</p>

<p>“Towns!” Cheyne echoed in his turn. “Then you must
have been right, Inspector, about those letters being merely
a blind.”</p>

<p>“I think so,” French admitted. “Look at it in this way. If
only the towns and coast were marked, the shape of England
would show too clearly. But adding those letter circles
disguises the thing—prevents the shape becoming apparent.
Now, I may be wrong, but I am beginning to question very
much if this map has anything to do with indicating a
position—I mean directly. I am beginning to think it is
merely a cipher. Let us test this at all events. Let us write
down the names of the towns in the order of the numbers
and see if that gives us anything.”</p>

<p>He took a sheet of paper, while Price found No. 1 on the
photograph and Cheyne identified its position with that of
a town on the atlas map.</p>

<p>“No. 1,” said Cheyne, “is Salisbury.”</p>

<p>French wrote down: “1, Salisbury.”</p>

<p>“No. 2,” went on Cheyne, “is Immingham.”</p>

<p>“2, Immingham,” wrote French, as he remarked,
“Salisbury—Immingham: S—I. That goes all right so far.”</p>

<p>The next three towns were Liverpool, Uttoxeter, and
Reading, and though none of the men could see where <span class="sc">silur</span> was leading, it was at least pronounceable.</p>

<p>But when the next three letters were added French gave
a mighty shout of victory. No. 6 was Ipswich, No. 7
Andover, and No. 8 Nottingham. <span class="sc">ian</span> added
to <span class="sc">silur</span> made Silurian.</p>

<p>“<em>Silurian!</em>” French cried, striking the table a mighty
blow with his clenched fist. “<em>Silurian!</em> That begins to show
a light!”</p>

<p>The others stared.</p>

<p>“Don’t you recognize the name?” went on French. “The <i>Silurian</i>
was a big Anchor liner, and she was torpedoed on
her way to the States with two and a half millions in gold
bars aboard!”</p>

<p>The others held their breath and their eyes grew round.</p>

<p>“Any of it recovered?”</p>

<p>“None: it was in mid-Atlantic.”</p>

<p>“But,” stammered Cheyne at last, “I don’t follow—”</p>

<p>“I don’t follow myself,” French returned briskly, “but
when the cipher which leads to a maritime expedition
begins with a wreck with two and a half millions aboard,
well then, I say it is suggestive. Come along, let’s read the
rest of the thing. We’ll know more then.”</p>

<p>With breathless eagerness the other towns were looked
up, and at last French’s list read as follows:</p>

<p>Taking the initials in order read:
Silurian­one­degree­west­nineteen­fathoms, or dividing it into its obvious
words—“<i>Silurian</i> one degree west nineteen fathoms.”</p>

<p>The three men stared at one another.</p>

<p>“Nineteen fathoms!” Price gasped at last. “But if she’s
in nineteen fathoms that gold will be salvable!”</p>

<p>French nodded.</p>

<p>“And I guess Dangle and Company have gone to salve
it. They wouldn’t want a salvage boat for gold. They’d get
it with a diver’s outfit.”</p>

<p>“But,” Cheyne went on in a puzzled tone, “I’ve not got
this straight yet. If she’s in nineteen fathoms, why has she
not been salved by the Admiralty? Look at the <i>Laurentic</i>.
She was put down off the Swilly in Ireland, and they
salved her gold. Five million pounds’ worth. Salved
practically every penny, and in twenty fathoms too.”</p>

<p>Price was considering another problem.</p>

<p>“One degree west,” he murmured. “What under heaven
does that mean? One degree west of what? Surely not the
meridian of Greenwich. If so, what is the latitude: there’s
no mention of it?”</p>

<p>French could not answer either of the questions, and he
did not try. Instead he picked up his telephone receiver
and made a call.</p>

<p>“Hallo! Is that Lloyd’s? Put me through to the Record
Department, please . . . Is Mr. Sam Pullar there? Tell him
Inspector French of Scotland Yard wants to speak to him . . .
Hallo, Sam! . . . Yes . . . Haven’t seen you for ages . . .
Look here, Sam, I want you to do me a favor. It’s
rather urgent, and I’d be grateful if you could look after it
just now. . . . Yes, I’ll hold on. I want to know anything
you can tell me about the sinking of the <i>Silurian</i>. You
remember, she had two and a half millions on her in gold,
and the U-boats got her somewhere between this country
and the States, I think in ’17 . . . What’s that? . . . Yes,
all that and anything else you can tell me.” He took the
receiver from his ear. “Friend of mine in Lloyd’s,” he
explained. “We ought to get some light from his reply.”</p>

<p>Silence reigned for a couple of minutes, then French
spoke again. “Let me repeat that,” he said, seizing a pad
and scribbling furiously. “Latitude 41 degrees 36 minutes
north, longitude 28 degrees 53 minutes west. Right. How
was that known? . . . But there was no direct information? . . .
Was the gold insured? . . . Well, it’s an involved
business, I could hardly tell you over the phone. I’ll explain
it first time we meet . . . Thank you, Sam. Much obliged.”</p>

<p>He rang off and then made a departmental call.</p>

<p>“Put me through to Inspector Barnes . . . That you,
Barnes? I’m on to something a bit in your line. Could you
come down here for half an hour?”</p>

<p>“Barnes is our authority on things nautical,” he told the
others. “Began life as a sailor and has studied all branches
of sea lore. We always give him shipping cases. We’ll wait
till he comes and then I’ll tell you what I learned from
Lloyd’s.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a strange thing,” Cheyne remarked, “that
Schulz should have chosen England for his map and
English for his cipher. Wouldn’t the natural thing have
been for him to have chosen Germany and German? He
could have headed it, for instance, ‘Deutschland über
Alles,’ and used the initials of German towns for his
phrase.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that,” French returned, “but we have to
remember he prepared the cipher to mislead Germans, not
English. In that case I think he was right to use English.
It made the thing more difficult.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished speaking when the door opened,
and a tall, alert-looking young man entered the room.
French introduced him as Inspector Barnes and pointed
to a chair.</p>

<p>“Seat yourself, Barnes, and listen to my tale. These
gentlemen are concerned with a curious story,” and he gave
a brief résumé of the strange events which had led up to
the existing situation. “Now,” he went on, “when we found
it was connected with the <i>Silurian</i> I rang up Sam Pullar
at Lloyd’s, and this is what he told me. The <i>Silurian</i> sailed
from this country on the 16th of February, 1917. She was
bound for New York, and she had two and a half millions
on her in bullion as well as a fair number of passengers.
She was a big boat—an Anchor liner of some 15,000 tons.
You remember about her?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should think so,” Barnes returned, as he lit a
cigarette. “Why, I was on that job—getting her away, I
mean. All kinds of precautions were taken. A tale was
started that she would load up the gold at Plymouth and
would sail—I forget the exact date now, but it was three
days after she did sail. It was my job to see that the
German spies about Plymouth got hold of this tale, and
we had evidence that they did get it, and moreover sent it
through to Germany, and that the U-boats were instructed
accordingly. As a matter of fact the <i>Silurian</i> came from
Brest, where she had landed army stores from South
America, and the bullion went out in a tender from
Folkestone, and was transferred at night in the Channel
in the middle of a ring of destroyers. While preparations
were being made at Plymouth for her arrival she was away
hundreds of miles towards the States.”</p>

<p>“But they got her all the same.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, they got her, but not all the same. She escaped
the boats that were looking out for her. It was a chance
boat that found her, somewhere, if I remember rightly,
near the Azores.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” French answered. “Instead of going
directly west, so Sam Pullar told me, she went south to
avoid those submarines you spoke of and which were
supposed to be operating off the Land’s End. Her course was
followed by wireless, down to near the Spanish coast, and
then across fairly due west. She was last seen by a Cape
boat some thirty miles west of Finisterre. Then a message
was received from her when she was some 250 miles north
of the Azores, that a U-boat had come along, and had
ordered her to stop. The message gave her position and
went on to say that a boat was coming aboard from the
submarine. Then it stopped, and that was the last thing
that was heard of her. Not a body or a boat or a bit of
wreckage was ever picked up, and it was clear that every
one on board was lost. Then after a time confirmation was
obtained. Our intelligence people in Germany intercepted
a report from the commander of the submarine who sank
her, giving details. She had been sunk in latitude 41° 36′
north, longitude 28° 53′ west, which confirmed the figures
sent out in her last wireless message. Four boats had got
away, but the commander had fired on them and had sunk
them one after another, so that not a single member of the
passengers or crew should survive.”</p>

<p>“Dirty savages,” Barnes commented. “But people in open
boats wouldn’t have had much chance there anyway,
particularly in February. If they had been able to keep afloat
at all, they would probably have missed the Azores, and
it’s very unlikely they would have made the Spanish or
Portuguese coast—it would have been too far.”</p>

<p>French pushed forward his atlas.</p>

<p>“Just whereabouts did she sink?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“About there.” Barnes indicated a point north of the
Azores. “But this atlas is too small to see it. Send someone
to my room for my large atlas. You’ll see better on that.”</p>

<p>French having telephoned his instructions Barnes went
on.</p>

<p>“She’s evidently lying on what is called the Dolphin
Rise. The Dolphin Rise is part of a great ridge which
passes down the middle of the Atlantic from near Iceland
to well down towards the Antarctic Ocean. This ridge is
covered by an average of some 1,700 fathoms of water,
with vastly greater depths on either side. It is volcanic and
is covered by great submarine mountain chains. Where the
tops of these mountains protrude above the surface we get,
of course, islands, and the Azores are such a group.”</p>

<p>A constable at that moment entered with the large atlas,
and Barnes continued:</p>

<p>“Now we’ll see in a moment.” He ran his finger down
the index of maps, then turned the pages. “Here we are.
Here is a map of the North Atlantic Ocean: here are the
Azores and hereabouts is your point, and—By Jove!” the
young man looked actually excited, “here is what your
cipher means all right!”</p>

<p>The other three crowded round in almost breathless
excitement. Barnes pointed with a pencil slightly to the
east of a white spot about a quarter of an inch in diameter
which bore the figure 18.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he went on, “there’s about the point she
is supposed to have sunk. You see it is colored light blue,
which the reference tells us means over 1,000 fathoms. But
measure one degree to the west—it is about fifty miles at
that latitude—and it brings us into the middle of that
white patch marked 18. That white patch is another
mountain chain, just not high enough to become an island,
and the 18 means that the peaks come within 18 fathoms
of the surface. So that your cipher message is probably
quite all right, and your Antwerp party are more than
likely working away at the gold at the present time.”</p>

<p>French swore comprehensively.</p>

<p>“You must be right,” he agreed. “One can see now what
that blackguard of a U-boat commander did. He evidently
put some men aboard the <i>Silurian</i> to dismantle their
wireless, then made them sail on parallel to his own course
until he had by the use of his lead maneuvered them over
the highest peak, and then put them down. The whole
thing must have been quite deliberate. He returned to his
own government a false statement of her position, which he
knew would correspond with the last message she sent out,
intending it to be believed that she was lost in over 1,000
fathoms. But he sank her where he could himself afterwards
recover her bullion, or sell his secret to the highest
bidder. The people on the <i>Silurian</i> would know all about
that two or three hours’ steam west, so they must be got
rid of. Hence his destroying the boats one after another.
No one must be left alive to give the thing away. To his
own crew he no doubt told some tale to account for it, but
he would be safe enough there, as no one except himself
would know the actual facts. Dirty savage indeed!”</p>

<p>With this speech of French’s a light seemed to Cheyne
suddenly to shine out over all that strange adventure in
which for so many weeks he had been involved. With it
each puzzling fact seemed to become comprehensible and
to drop into its natural place in the story as the pieces of
a jigsaw puzzle eventually make a coherent whole. He
pictured the thing from the beginning, the submarine coming
up with the ship in deep water, but comparatively close
to a shallow place where its treasure could be salved: the
desire of the U-boat commander, Schulz, to save the gold,
quite possibly in the first instance for the benefit of his
nation. Then the temptation to keep what he had done
secret so as, if possible later, to get the stuff for himself.
His fall before this temptation, with its contingent false
return to his government as to the position of the wreck.
Then, Cheyne saw, the problem of passing on the secret in
the event of his own death would arise, with the evolution
and construction of the cipher as an attempted solution.
As a result of Schulz’s fatal wound the cipher was handed
to Price, and Schulz was doubtless about to explain how
it should be read, when he was interrupted by the nurse.
Before another chance offered he was dead.</p>

<p>Given the fact that Dangle overheard the dying man’s
story, and that Dangle’s character was what it was, Cheyne
now saw that the remainder of his adventure could
scarcely have happened otherwise than as it had. To
obtain the cipher was Dangle’s obvious course, and there
was no reason to doubt his own statement of how he set
about it. A search among Price’s papers showed the latter
had sent the document to Cheyne, and from Cheyne
Dangle had evidently decided to obtain it. But nothing
could be done till after the war, nor, presumably, without
financial and other help. In this lay, doubtless, the reason
for the application to Blessington and Sime, and these two
being roped in, the unscrupulous trio set themselves to
work. Susan Dangle assisted by obtaining a post as servant
at Warren Lodge, and thus gained detailed information
which enabled the others to lay their plans. And so in a
quite orderly sequence event had followed event, until now
it looked as if the climax had been reached.</p>

<p>Like a flash these thoughts passed through Cheyne’s
mind, and like a flash he saw what depended on them.
Now they knew where Joan Merrill had been taken. If she
was still alive—and he simply could not bring himself to
admit any other possibility—she was on that boat of
Merkel’s some two hundred and fifty miles north of the
Azores! From that something surely followed. He turned
to French and spoke in a voice which was hoarse from
anxiety.</p>

<p>“What about an expedition to the place?”</p>

<p>French nodded decisively.</p>

<p>“We must arrange one without delay,” he said. “I think
the Admiralty is our hope. That gold wasn’t insured—it
was a government business. I’ll go and tell the chief about
it now, and get him to see the proper authorities.
Meanwhile,” he looked, for French, quite sharply at the others,
“not a word of this must be breathed.”</p>

<p>Intense interest was excited in the higher circles of the
Admiralty by the news which reached them from the
Yard. Great personages bestirred themselves to issue orders,
with the result that with enormously more promptitude
than the man in the street can bring himself to associate
with a Government Department, a fast boat, well equipped
with divers and gear, was got ready for sea. French put in
a word for both Cheyne and Price, and when, some eight
hours after their reading of the cipher, the boat put out
into the Thames from Chatham Dockyard, it carried in
addition to its regular crew not only Inspector French
himself, but also his two protégés.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch20">

<h2>Chapter XX. <br/> The Goal of the “L’Escaut”</h2>

<p>Inspector French had gone to bed in the tiny but
comfortable stateroom which had been put at his disposal by
the officers of the Admiralty boat while that redoubtable
vessel was slipping easily and on an even keel through the
calm waters of the Straits of Dover. He awoke next morning
to find her plunging and rolling and staggering through
what, in comparison with his previous experiences of the
sea, appeared to be a frightful storm. To his surprise,
however, he did not feel any bad effects from the motion, and
presently he arose, and having with extreme care
performed the ticklish operation of shaving, dressed and
climbed with the aid of railings and handles to the
companionway, and so to the deck.</p>

<p>The sight which met his eyes on emerging made him
hold his breath, as he clung to the rail at the companion
door. It was a wonderful morning, clear and bright and
fresh and invigorating. The sun shone down from a cloudless
sky on to a dark sapphire sea of incredible purity,
flecked over with foaming patches of dazzling white. As
far as the eye could reach in every direction out to the
hard sharp line of the horizon, great waves rolled
relentlessly onward, wavelets dancing and churning and
foaming on their slow-moving flanks. The wind caught French
and, as if it were a solid, held him pinned against the
deckhouse. He stood watching the bluff bows of the boat
rise in the air, then crash back into the sea, throwing out
a smother of water and foam some of which would seep
over the fo’c’sle, and after swirling through the forward
deck hamper, disappear through the scuppers amidships.</p>

<p>For some moments he watched, then moving round the
deckhouse, he glanced up and saw Cheyne and Price
beckoning to him from the bridge, where they had joined the
officer of the watch.</p>

<p>“Some morning this, Inspector,” Price cried, as he joined
them in the lee of the weather canvas. “This will blow the
London cobwebs out of our minds.”</p>

<p>He was evidently keenly enjoying himself, and even
Cheyne’s anxious face showed appreciation of his
surroundings. And soon French himself, having realized that
they were not necessarily going to the bottom in a
hurricane, but merely running down Channel in a fresh
southwesterly breeze, began to feel the thrill of the sea, and to
believe that the end of his quest was going to develop into
a novel and delightful holiday trip.</p>

<p>The same weather held all that day and the next, but
on the third the wind fell, and the sea gradually calmed
down to a slow, easy swell. The sun grew hotter, and
basking in it in the lee of the deckhouse became a delight.
Little was said about the object of the expedition. French
and Price were content to enjoy the present, and Cheyne
managed to keep his anxieties to himself. The ship’s officers
were a jolly crowd, immensely excited by their quest, and
conducting themselves as the kindly hosts of welcome
guests.</p>

<p>On the fourth day it grew still warmer, indeed out of
the breeze made by the ship’s motion it was unpleasantly
hot. French liked to get away forward, where it was cooler,
and leaned by the hour over the bows, watching the sharp
stem cut through the water and roll back in its frothing
wave on either side. Dolphins were now to be seen
swimming in the clear water, and two hung at the bows, one
on each side, apparently motionless for long periods, until
suddenly they would dart ahead, spiral round one another
and then return to their places.</p>

<p>That fourth evening the captain joined his passengers as
the trio were smoking on deck.</p>

<p>“If we carry on like this,” he remarked, “we should
reach the position about four <span class="sc">a.m.</span> But those beggars
may be taking a risk and not showing a light, so I propose to
slow down from now on, in order not to arrive till
daylight. Come on deck about six. If they’re here we should
raise them between then and seven.”</p>

<p>French, waking early next morning, could not control
his excitement and remain in his berth until the allotted
time. He rose at five, and went on deck with the somewhat
shamefaced feeling that he was acting as a small boy, who
on Christmas morning must needs get up on waking to
investigate the possibilities of stockings. But he need not
have feared ridicule from his companions. Both Cheyne
and Price were already on the bridge, and the skipper
stood with his telescope glued to his eye as he searched
the horizon ahead. All three were evidently thrilled by the
approaching finale, and a slight incoherence was
discernible in their somewhat scrappy conversation.</p>

<p>The morning was calm and very clear. Once again the
sky was cloudless, and the soft southwesterly wind barely
ruffled the surface of the long flat swells. It was a pleasure
to be alive, and it seemed impossible to associate crime
and violence with the expedition. But beneath their smiles
all concerned felt it might easily develop into a grim
enough business. And that side of it became more apparent
when at the captain’s order the covers of the six-pounders
mounted fore and aft were removed, and the weapons
were prepared for action by their crews.</p>

<p>The hands of French’s watch had just reached the
quarter hour after six, when Captain Amery, who had
once again been sweeping the horizon with his telescope,
said quietly: “There she is.” He handed the glass to
French. “See there, about three points on the starboard
bow.”</p>

<p>French, with some difficulty steadying the tube, saw
very faint and far off what looked like the upper part of
a steamer’s deck, with a funnel, and two masts like
threads of the finest gossamer. “She’s still hull down,” the
captain explained. “You’ll see her better in a few minutes.
We should be up with her in three-quarters of an hour.”</p>

<p>In order to leave them free later on, it was decided to
have breakfast at once, and by the time the hasty meal had
been disposed of the stranger was clearly visible to the
naked eye. She lay heading westward, as though anchored
in the swing of the tide, and her fires appeared to be either
out or banked, as no smoke was visible at her funnel. The
glass revealed a flag at her forepeak, but she was still too
far off to make out its coloring.</p>

<p>Now that the dramatic climax was approaching, the
minds of the actors in the play became charged with a
very real anxiety. Captain Amery, under almost any
circumstances, would have to deal with a very ticklish
situation. He had to get the gold, if it was salvable, and the
fact that they were not in British waters would be a
complication if the Belgian had already recovered it. French
had to ascertain if his quarry were on board, and if so, see
that they did not escape him—also a difficult job outside
the three-mile limit. For Price a fortune hung in the
balance—not of course all the gold that might be found, but
the proportion allowed him by law; while for Cheyne there
remained something a thousand times more important
than the capture of a criminal or the acquisition of a
fortune—for Cheyne the question of Joan Merrill’s life
was at stake. Their several anxieties were reflected on the
faces of the men, as they stood in silence, watching the
rapidly growing vessel.</p>

<p>Presently an exclamation came from Captain Amery.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he said, “this is a rum business. I can see that
flag now, and it’s our red ensign. What’s a Belgian boat
doing with a British flag? And what’s more, it’s jack down—a
flag of distress. What do you think of that?” He looked
at the others with a puzzled expression, then went on: “I
suppose they’re not armed? You don’t know, Inspector,
do you? If they were armed it would be a likely enough ruse
to get us close by, so as to make sure of hitting us in a
vital place.”</p>

<p>French shook his head. He had heard nothing about
arms, though for all he knew to the contrary the <i>L’Escaut</i>
might carry a gun.</p>

<p>“I don’t see one,” the captain continued, “but then if
they have one they’d keep it hidden. But I don’t like there
being no signs of life aboard her. There’s no smoke
anywhere, either from her boilers or her galley. There’s no one
on the bridge, and I’ve not seen a movement on deck. It
doesn’t look well: in fact it looks as if they were lying low
and waiting for us.”</p>

<p>They were now within a mile of the stranger, and her
details were clear even to the naked eye.</p>

<p>“It’s the <i>L’Escaut</i> anyway,” Captain Amery went on.
“I can see the name on her bows. But I confess I don’t
like that flag and that silence. I think I’ll see if I can
wake her up.”</p>

<p>He put his hand on the foghorn halliard and blew a
number of resounding blasts. For a few seconds nothing
happened, then suddenly two figures appeared at the
deckhouse door, and after a moment’s pause, rushed up on
the bridge and began waving furiously. As they passed up
the bridge ladder they came from behind the shelter of a
boat and their silhouettes became visible against the sky.
They were both women!</p>

<p>A strangled cry burst from Cheyne as he snatched the
captain’s telescope and gazed at them, then with a shout
of “It’s she! It’s she!” he leaped to the end of the bridge
and began waving his hat frantically.</p>

<p>At this moment two other figures appeared on the
fo’c’sle and, apparently moving to the vessel’s side, stood
watching the newcomers. Amery rang his engines down
to half speed and, slightly porting his helm, headed for
some distance astern of the other. Then starboarding, he
swung round, and bringing up parallel to her and some
couple of hundred yards away, he dropped anchor.</p>

<p>Without loss of a moment a boat was lowered, and
French, Cheyne, Price, the first officer, and a half dozen
men, all armed with service revolvers, tumbled in. Giving
way lustily, they pulled for the Belgian.</p>

<p>It was by this time possible to distinguish the features of
the women, and French was not surprised to learn they
were Joan Merrill and Susan Dangle. Evidently they
recognized Cheyne, who kept waving furiously as if he
found the movement necessary to relieve his overwrought
feelings. The two figures forward were those of men, and
these stood watching the boat, though without exhibiting
any of the transports of delight of their fellow shipmates
on the bridge.</p>

<p>As they drew closer Joan made signs to them to go
round to the other side of the ship, and dropping round
her stern they saw a ladder rigged. In a few seconds they
were alongside, and Cheyne, leaping out before the
others, rushed up the steps and reached the deck.</p>

<p>If there had been any doubts as to the real relations
between himself and Joan, these were set at rest at that
moment. Instinctively he opened his arms, and Joan,
swept off her feet by her emotion, threw herself into them
and clung to him, while tears of joy and relief ran down
her cheeks. As far as Cheyne was concerned, Susan
Dangle, the figures on the fo’c’sle, French, and the men behind
him might as well not have existed. He crushed Joan
violently to him, covering her face and hair with burning
kisses, as he murmured brokenly of his love and of his
thankfulness for her safety.</p>

<p>French, anxious to learn the state of affairs and seeing
nothing was to be got from Joan, turned expectantly to
Susan Dangle. What could these unexpected developments
mean? Was Susan, the enemy, now a friend?
Where were the others? Were the ship’s company friends
or foes? Could he ask her questions which might
incriminate her without giving her a formal warning?</p>

<p>But his curiosity would brook no delay.</p>

<p>“I am Inspector French of Scotland Yard,” he
announced, while Price and the first officer stood round
expectantly. “You are Miss Susan Dangle. Where are the
other members of this expedition?”</p>

<p>The girl wrung her hands, and he noticed how terribly
pale and drawn was her face and what horror shone in
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, with a gesture as if to shut out the sight
of some hideous dream. “Oh, it’s been awful! I can’t
speak of it. They’re dead! My brother James, Charles
Sime, Mr. Merkel, most of the crew, dead—all dead! Mr.
Blessington wounded—probably dying! They got fighting
over the gold!” She began suddenly to laugh, a terrible
high cackling laugh, that made her hearers shiver, and
attracted the attention even of Joan and Cheyne.</p>

<p>French stepped quickly forward and seized her arm.</p>

<p>“There now, Miss Dangle,” he said kindly but firmly.
“Stop that and pull yourself together. Your terrible
experiences are over now and you’re in the hands of friends. But
you mustn’t give way like this. Make an effort, and you’ll
be better directly.” He led her to a hatchway and made her
sit down, while he continued soothing her as one would a
fractious child.</p>

<p>But so great was the agitation of both girls that it was
quite a considerable time before the tragic tale of
the <i>L’Escaut’s</i> expedition became fully unfolded. And when at
last it was told it proved still but one more illustration of
the old truth that the qualities of greed and envy and
selfishness have that seed of decay within themselves which
leads their unhappy victims to overreach themselves, and
instead of gaining what they seek, to lose their all. Shorn
of incoherent phrases and irrelevant details the story was
this.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May the <i>L’Escaut</i> had left Antwerp
with twenty-eight souls aboard. Aft there were Joan,
Susan, Blessington, Sime, Dangle, and Merkel, with the
captain, first officer, and engineer—nine persons, while
forward were three divers, six assistants, a cook, a steward,
four seamen, and four engine-room staff, or nineteen
altogether. Once clear of the Scheldt Joan’s treatment had
changed. Her food was no longer drugged, and when in a
few days she got over the effects of the doses she had
received, she found her jailers polite and friendly and
anxious to minimize the inconvenience and anxiety she
was suffering. They told her they did not wish her evil,
and were taking her with them simply to prevent information
as to themselves or their affairs leaking out through
her. This, of course, she did not believe, since she did not
possess sufficient information about them to enable her to
interfere with their plans. But later their real motive
dawned on her. Gradually she realized that Blessington
had fallen in love with her, and though he was
circumspect enough, her distrust of him was such that she felt
sick with horror and dread when she thought of him.
Nothing, however, had occurred to which she could take
exception, and had it not been for her fears as to her own fate
and her anxieties as to Cheyne’s, the voyage would have
been pleasant enough.</p>

<p>The <i>L’Escaut</i> was a fast boat, and four days had
brought them to the spot referred to in the cipher. After
three days’ search they found the wreck, and all three
divers had at once gone down. A week was spent in
making an examination of the vessel, at the end of which time
they had located the gold. It was in her stern, low down
and not far from her port side. The divers recommended
blowing her plates off at this spot, and ten days more
sufficed for this. Through the hole thus made the divers
were able to draw in tackle lowered from the <i>L’Escaut</i>,
and the ingots of gold were slung to cradles and drawn
up with really wonderful ease and speed. They had,
moreover, been favored with a peculiarly fine stretch of
weather, work having to be suspended on only eight days
of the thirty-seven they were there.</p>

<p>On reaching the wreck in the first instance the captain
had mustered his crew aft and had informed them—what
he could no longer keep secret—that they were out for
gold, and that if they found it in the quantities they
hoped, every man on board would receive at the end of
the trip a gift of £1,000 in addition to his pay. The men
at first seemed more than satisfied, but as ingot after ingot
was recovered the generosity of the offer shrank in their
estimation. Four days before the appearance of French’s
party the divers had reported that another day would
complete the work, and then appeared the first hint that all
was not well. On that last evening before the completion
of the diving the men came forward in a body and asked
to see the captain. They explained that they had been
reckoning up the value of the gold, and they weren’t
having £1,000 apiece: they wanted an even divide all round.
The captain argued with them civilly enough at first—told
them that they couldn’t get the metal ashore and
turned into money in secret, that the port officers or
coastguards wherever it was unloaded would be bound to learn
what they were doing and that then the government would
claim an enormous percentage of the whole, so that the
£1,000 per man was an extremely liberal gift. The men
declared that they would look after the unloading, and
that they were going to have what they wanted. Hot
words passed, and then the captain drew a revolver and
said that he was captain there, and that what he said
would go. Susan was watching the scene from the quarter-deck
behind, but she could not be quite sure of what followed.
One of the crew pressed forward and the captain
raised his revolver. She did not think he meant to fire, but
another of the men either genuinely or purposely
misunderstood his action. He raised his hand, a shot rang out,
and the captain fell dead. The mutineers were evidently
terribly upset by a murder which they had apparently
never intended, and had Blessington and Sime acted
intelligently, the trouble might have gone no further. But
at that moment these two worthies, who must have been
in the chart-house all the time, began firing through the
windows at the men. A regular pitched battle ensued, in
which Sime and five of the crew were hit, three of the
latter being killed. It was then war to the knife between
those who berthed forward and those who berthed aft. All
that night sporadic shots rang out at intervals, but at
daybreak on the following day matters came to a head. The
crew with considerable generalship made a feint on the
fo’c’sle with some of their number while the remainder
swarmed aft below decks. The defenders, taken in the rear,
were shot down, and the mutineers were masters of the
ship.</p>

<p>All that next day Joan and Susan, terror-stricken,
clung to each other in the latter’s cabin. The men were
reasonably civil: told them they might get themselves
food, and let them alone. But that night a further terrible
quarrel burst out between, as they learned afterwards,
those who wished to murder the girls and go off with the
treasure and those who feared murder more than the loss
of the gold. Once again there were the reports of shots
and the groans of wounded men. The fusillade went on at
intervals all night, until next morning one of the divers—a
superior man with whom the girls had often talked—had
come in with his head covered with blood, and asked
the girls to bandage it. Susan had some slight surgical
knowledge, and did what she could for him. Then the
man told them that of the entire ship’s company only
themselves and seven others were alive, and that of these
seven four were so badly wounded that they would
probably not recover. Among these was Blessington. Sime and
James Dangle were dead.</p>

<p>The slightly injured men threw the dead overboard and
cleaned up the traces of the fighting, while the girls
ministered to the seriously wounded. Of course, in the three
days up till the arrival of the avengers—who had by a
strange trick of fate become the rescuers—one man had
died. Of the eight-and-twenty who sailed from Antwerp
there were therefore left only nine: the two girls and four
slightly and three seriously wounded men. None of those
able to move understood either engineering or seamanship,
so that they had luckily decided to remain at anchor
in the hope of some ship picking up their flag of distress.</p>

<p>“There is just one thing I should like to understand,”
said Cheyne to Joan, when later on that day a prize crew
had been put aboard the <i>L’Escaut</i> and steam was being
raised for the return to England, “and that is what
happened to you on the night that we burgled Earlswood.
You got back to your rooms, then left again with Sime
and Blessington?”</p>

<p>“There’s not much to tell about that,” Joan answered,
smiling happily up into her lover’s eyes. “I was, as you
know, standing like a watchman before the door of
Earlswood, when I saw Susan and her brother coming up. I
rang and knocked and kept them talking as long as
possible. Then when they opened the door I slipped away, but
I heard your footsteps and realized that you had got out by
the back way. I heard you run off down the lane with
Dangle after you, then remembering your arrangement
about throwing away the tracing, I climbed over the wall,
picked it up and went back to my rooms. The first thing
I did was to photograph it, then I hid it in my color box.
I had scarcely done so when Sime called. He said you had
met with an accident—been caught between two motorcars
and knocked down by one of them—and that you
were seriously injured. He said you were conscious and had
given him my address and were calling for me. I went
down to find Blessington driving a car, though I didn’t
know then it was Blessington. As soon as we started Sime
held a chloroformed cloth over my mouth, and I don’t
remember much more till we were on the <i>L’Escaut</i>.”</p>

<p>“But how did Sime find your rooms?”</p>

<p>“Through Susan. Susan told me all about it afterwards.
She went out after James and saw me climbing over the
wall with the tracing. She followed me to my rooms and
immediately telephoned to Sime. When Sime called she
was with him, and while I changed my coat Sime let her
into the studio and she hid behind an easel until we were
gone. She searched till she found the tracing and then
simply walked out. The gang had intended to go to
Antwerp the following week in any case, but this business
upset their plans and they decided to start immediately.
Dangle went on and arranged for the <i>L’Escaut</i> to leave
some days earlier. The rest of us put up at Ghent till she
was ready to sail.” But little further remains to be told.
The few bars of gold still left on the <i>Silurian</i> were soon
raised and the two ships set sail, reaching Chatham some
five days later. All the bullion theoretically belonged to the
Crown, but under the special circumstances a generous
division was made whereby twenty-five per cent was
returned to the finders. As Price refused to accept the
whole amount an amicable agreement was come to,
whereby Cheyne, Joan, and Price each received almost
one-third, or £200,000 apiece. Of the balance of over
£20,000, £10,000 was given to Susan Dangle by Joan’s
imperative directions. She said that Susan was not a bad
girl and had turned up trumps during the trouble on
the <i>L’Escaut</i>. £1,000 went to Inspector French—also Joan’s
gift, and the remainder was divided among the officers
and men of the Admiralty salvage boat.</p>

<p>A few days after landing Maxwell Cheyne and Joan
Merrill had occasion to pay a short visit to the church of
St. Margaret’s in the Fields, after which Cheyne whirled
his wife away to Devonshire, so that she might make the
acquaintance of his family and see the country where
began that strange series of events which in the
beginning of the story I alluded to as <span class="sc">The Cheyne Mystery</span>.</p>
